After his last salesperson quit, Jason made a radical decision: replace his entire go-to-market team with AI agents. What started as an experiment has transformed into a new operating model, where 20 AI agents managed by just 1.2 humans now do the work previously handled by a team of 10 SDRs and AEs. In this conversation, Jason shares his hands-on experience implementing AI to run his sales org, including what works, what doesn’t, and how the GTM landscape is quickly being transformed.\n\n*We discuss:*\n1. How AI is fundamentally changing the sales function\n2. Why most SDRs and BDRs will be “extinct” within a year\n3. What Jason is observing across his portfolio about AI adoption in GTM\n4. How to become “hyper-employable” in the age of AI\n5. The specific AI tools and tactics he’s using that have been working best\n6. Practical frameworks for integrating AI into your sales motion without losing what works\n7.

Based on these experiences, they’ve developed a small set of best practices for building and scaling successful AI products. The goal of this conversation is to save you and your team a lot of pain and suffering.\n\n*We discuss:*\n1. Two key ways AI products differ from traditional software, and why that fundamentally changes how they should be built\n2. Common patterns and anti-patterns in companies that build strong AI products versus those that struggle\n3. A framework they developed from real-world experience to iteratively build AI products that create a flywheel of improvement\n4. Why obsessing about customer trust and reliability is an underrated driver of successful AI products\n5. Why evals aren’t a cure-all, and the most common misconceptions people have about them\n6.

He was able to do so because President Donald Trump during his first term commuted his 24-year sentence for a previous conviction. Now Weinstein is said to be planning to ask Trump for clemency again.\n\nWithin months of his release in 2021, Weinstein returned to scamming, stealing from unsuspecting victims until he was caught and convicted again, this time sentenced to 37 years in prison. While the administration contends it carefully weighs all petitions, the case points up what critics argue is a radical new system of how presidential clemency is granted, one where financial resources, connections and politics govern who goes free and who does not. \n\nLearn more: Freed by Trump, a $200 Million Fraudster Started a New Scam - https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-eli-weinstein-ponzi-fraud/?srnd=phx-bigtake\n\n0:00 The cost of clemency\n1:37 The deal\n3:04 Eli Weinstein’s second chance\n4:45 Doing something good for the world\n5:42 The puppet master\n7:26 The brink of destruction\n10:52 The story isn’t over\n13:34 The purpose of clemency\n15:31 The system\n17:08 Out of chances?\n\nHelp shape the future of Bloomberg Video.

Arlan breaks down the mindset of execution, arguing that the only difference between an average career and the scale of figures like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk is a commitment to curiosity and a refusal to self-limit.\n\nThis philosophy of \"doing things that don't scale\" and having \"unreasonable determination\" is exactly what Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham looks for in world-class founders.
