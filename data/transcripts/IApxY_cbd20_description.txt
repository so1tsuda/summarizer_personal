SoundHound AI stock is still attracting tons of hype, but is it justified? Last time we looked at the company, we concluded that their stock was due for a spectacular crash. This was because of their massive valuation, weak organic revenue growth, and reliance on acquisitions. Today, these issues still persist. SoundHound isn't some diamond in the rough. It's not the next NVIDIA. It's an overvalued company with a commodity offering. Don't believe us? Watch the video!
