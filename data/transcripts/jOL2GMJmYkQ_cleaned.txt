Solving the AI energy crisis with nuclear energy is taking a while. And in the meantime, data centers are scrambling to find energy sources. One answer could be fuel cells, a technology that checks all the boxes and more. Modular fuel cell systems can be deployed in less than a year. They're 10 to 30% more efficient than gas turbines, and they emit fewer emissions as well. They're also quieter, and they come with more load versatility. But that doesn't mean I should immediately go out and start adding fuel cell stocks to my portfolio. Not all fuel cell stocks are created equal. We've been covering the fuel cell thesis for over a decade now. And if fuel cells were ever going to have their big moment, it's now. Today, we're going to do three things. We're going to check for fuel cell ETFs. We're then going to identify a universe of fuel cell stocks. And we're going to identify companies that we might want to dig further into. So, let's get my Lambo journey started and jump right into a list of stonks we can choose from. About 5 years ago, we published a guide to investing in fuel cell stocks and identified 10 names of interest. Today, our tech stock catalog holds eight fuel cell stocks and one fuel cell ETF, the Global X Hydrogen ETF. So, let's start there. It trades under the ticker HYDR. It has less than $100 million in assets under management. So that means that not a lot of investors are interested in the fuel cell thesis right now. It has an expense ratio of 50 BIPS. Seems about right for an actively managed ETF and just 25 constituents. So it's going to be very concentrated. What we've done here is pulled up a list of the top 10 constituents that account for about 70% of the entire ETF. And what we can then do is cross-check that list against our own list. And here I've pulled it up. You see I've excluded two names here that don't have revenues. So our rule, probably one of the most effective rules we have for taking out the trash is simply this: No meaningful revenues, no interest, no exceptions. That's a showstopper. We don't go any further. So, of the remaining names, six are overlapping with the top 10 on the Global X list, which means there are some names we're missing. However, we have covered some of these missing names. And I'll tell you one thing that's great about our growing community of global investors is the network effect. So, the more people that begin subscribing to our channel, our premium content, and following our brand, the more information gets fed to us. And a longtime reader of ours who lives somewhere in the Nordic region, brought up a few names. This was nearly 5 years ago, names he said we ought to look at. Power Cell Sweden and also this Nel Hydrogen from Norway. We'll take a look at those trying to answer two basic questions. First of all, are they growing revenues? Right? You can't be disrupting anything if you're not growing revenues. And are they being hyped? So, starting with Power Cell, what we see starting off would be consistent revenue growth. This looks really nice, right? And a positive gross margin. Whether or not operating income turns positive. We can figure that out later on down the road. So, looking at this fundamental data, you would expect that since the company was raised 5 years ago that the stock price ought to have performed quite well, right? Wrong. This is rather surprising. Stock price is down 86%. Now, for whatever reason, I've seen this same playbook unfold for many foreign stocks over the years. I don't know why. So, it's this initial extreme overvaluation of the company and their thesis followed by a long period of time where presumably the share price comes back down to reality. And what we can do here is calculate a price-to-sales ratio. That's a basic method of looking at valuation. And in our case, we use what's called a simple valuation ratio. That's just market cap divided by annualized revenues. Now, we're going to use trailing 12-month revenues for all these calculations in this presentation because for most these firms, quarterly revenues are sporadic. So, we've done that. Here you get a simple valuation ratio. So, basically, price- to-sales of around five. That's around our catalog average. That's what you'd expect. So, the valuation has sort of reverted to the mean over time. Fundamentals have improved while share price has sunk. And when you start looking at what you're getting exposure to here, projects, so that you see there, dominates their revenues. We don't like project-based companies, right? We want to see other things here. Services and royalty fees. These are sustainable over time. So, this is a company that's too small to be on our radar despite the fact that they seem to have a growing business that relates to fuel cells. The other Nordic stock on our list here, NEL ASA, they have growing revenues, $422 million market cap, $99 million and trailing 12 months revenues. And that gives them a simple valuation ratio of around four. So, about the same as the other stock, right? Since shares have dropped 90% over the past 5 years, if there was ever a time to look at these two Nordic fuel cell stocks, it would be now. That's not just because these share prices have plummeted. It's because their fundamentals are showing some strength. And when we try to explain the decrease in share price value over the past 5 years, what we can do is pull up the Global X Hydrogen ETF, HYDR, and we can take a look at what that's done. That's our benchmark. Look, it's down 70%. Now, that explains it. So, the entire fuel cell thesis has been on a decline for the last 5 years. And we may be moving into a different era where fuel cells are no longer a solution looking for a problem. There's a problem that fuel cells can solve, potentially. And that's the AI energy crisis. And investors seem to be figuring that out to a certain extent. Here you can see volume has increased significantly. You see this spike in volume over the past several months. So investors may be thinking the same thing as Goldman Sachs, which is that fuel cells will be able to solve potentially a lot of the short-term problems with energy supply that the AI industry is facing. So here's something that you really want to pay attention to. Oftentimes, these hardware companies, especially in the green tech space, tend to subsidize their products to get them off the ground. And you can only sustain this act for so long. So, a number of the larger fuel cell companies out there are not worth looking at until they sort this problem out. The biggest example that we've been pointing to for years as problematic is Plug Power. Back in 2023, we looked at their inability to sell a product or service at a profit. That was the last time we looked at them. That was all expected to change in 2023 because of this green hydrogen they were going to produce internally. Well, it didn't. This company has now been around for 26 years, and they're always on the cusp of a positive gross margin. And when you look at their fundamentals, they're worse than ever. They're not even close to approaching a positive gross margin. I don't know what this is, but it's not a sustainable business. It's nothing we'd ever want to have anything to do with. And it's even more surprising to see that they're not alone. Another company subsidizing their products, Fuel Cell Energy, here, trading under the ticker FCEL. Negative gross profits across the board, no interest at all. And not surprisingly, their share price is down 96% over the past five years. No matter how hard the cheerleaders try to resuscitate it, they may see some temporary stock price appreciation. But if you do what we do, which is focus on investing in companies, not stocks, then you're going to see that this isn't something that's worth looking at until they solve the gross margin problem. Remember, a declining share price doesn't equate to value when the fundamentals are absolute [ __ ] And also, in this list of companies that can't seem to produce a product or service and sell it for more than it costs to produce would be Ballard. There's nothing to see here. Also, a negative gross profit over time. Now, when it comes to the two UK stocks in our list, we also have ITM Power with a negative gross margin. Nothing to see there. However, there are a few companies out there worth investigating. One would be Ceres Power Holdings. They have an $888 million market cap. So, they're under our $1 billion threshold. However, what we see here are growing revenues over time. So, these are in British pounds. So, multiply, what, by 1.3 or so. And we've done that. We've translated British pounds into US dollars along the bottom here. $888 million market cap, around $60 million in trailing 12-month revenues, giving them an SVR of 15. So, you see, they're more richly priced, and there's good reason for that. Take a look at their gross profit margins. Wow. Right? So, they're approaching 80%. Now, of course, they've been a little volatile over time, but in looking at their investor deck, they're claiming to have lots of upside for data centers. I would want to know where these strong gross margins are coming from. So there's certainly some digging that could happen here for UK investors or any investor that's looking for some exposure that would also give you exposure to the British pound. So that brings us to the two Korean stocks that aren't in our catalog but made their way onto the Global X ETF. First is Doosan Fuel Cell Company. This is a $ 1.9 billion firm with almost $400 million in trailing 12-month revenues, an SVR of five, right? So you see some consistency there across geographies in the same theme. But what's worth noting here is this dramatic drop in gross profit. So this is potentially a company that you might want to dig into. And I think figuring out that gross margin anomaly is going to teach you a lot about their business. The other Korean stock here, Vina Tech, $327 million company, 50 million in revenues, SVR of six. Again, some consistency there in valuation. But, couple things to note here. First of all, it's below our market cap threshold. They do have growing revenues, but you see they're sort of sporadic. So, you'd want to understand their business and pay attention to the increase in volatility that could be exacerbated by Korean retail investors right now. It just seems to be something you observe across all these names because of an increased interest in fuel cell stocks. However, that brings us to probably the most notable name in the list, perhaps the one that's worth investigating in the most. That would be Bloom Energy. And you need to be very careful here. This article in Fortune says it all. Bloom Energy stock is up a 1000% in a year because its fuel cells are solving AI's data center power problem. No, that's not why it's up. It's up because of hype. Intrinsic value doesn't change that quickly. So, it was significantly undervalued before, presumably, and now it's overvalued. At least not as bad as we had thought. So, $28 billion company, $1.8 billion in trailing 12-month revenues, and SVR 15. So three times that of the other stocks. But perhaps there's a good reason for that. And when you look at their margins, that's very important. That's been a recurring theme throughout this presentation. See how they started out with negative gross margins and they moved into positive. So you would have also seen, I think Rocket Lab did that. And when Rocket Lab actually started to show positive gross margins, that turned out to be the right time to invest in the stock. And here you can see, lately, they're hitting 30% gross margins. I suppose that's pretty good for a hardware platform. Certainly better than negative gross margins, right? And their operating margin is starting to move above zero. So there's certainly something to look at there in a future presentation we're going to do on Bloom Energy. So when you have a thesis like fuel cells, you always want to start out with a universe of stocks, as we've done today. Anything below a sustained $1 billion market cap is not on our radar. You might want to have your own market cap cut-off. And negative gross margins are always showstoppers. We always invest in leaders. These are usually the larger of the lot. And right now, our short list of all the stocks we've looked at today seem to be Doosan, which a lot of people are probably not familiar with; Bloom Energy, which a lot of people are familiar with; and Ceres, which might be worth a poke around for those that dabble in smaller stocks. So, fuel cell stocks do not appear to be hyped. Yet. But they may be. So, pay attention to that. And remember that hype is never a good reason to invest in any thesis. Now, I know a lot of you are looking beyond solutions for today's energy problems into how we solve tomorrow's energy problems, and that seems to be nuclear energy. Though, you really need to be careful about the hype. We've got you covered in this recent piece that looks at some nuclear stocks that many DGens have been buying high and selling low. Molasses make for a great tax write off. Yes, yes, they do. So, give this video on investing in nuclear stocks a watch next. Thanks so much for taking the time to watch this video today.
