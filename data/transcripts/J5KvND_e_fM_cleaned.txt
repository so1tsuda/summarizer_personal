They say that the most appealing investment thesis has two key components. Number one is the promise of future riches. So that goes without saying. But number two is much more interesting. The most attractive thesis proposed is that you only realize your gains when the rest of the world is collapsing. It's critically important that people that don't have your Nostradamus-like investing acumen suffer while you wallow in wealth. And that's the primal reason why investing in precious metals is so appealing to so many retail investors. Today, we're going to teach you everything you need to know about investing in silver. You're going to learn a lot in a very short period of time. I promise. Now, we're not invested in silver directly, but we are enjoying the benefits. Can you guess why? That's right, gold. We happen to hold gold as one of our alternative assets and we've been enjoying a similar price appreciation as silver. That's because gold and silver are highly correlated, which means the prices typically move together. I love this tool here, Portfolio Visualizer. What it lets you do is put in various assets and see the correlations over time. This is rather interesting. We've taken two of the largest Precious Metals ETFs, the Silver ETF and Gold ETF, and looked at their correlations over time. So, it's interesting to see a drop off around the time of the Rona. But these are still highly correlated. So, anything above 0.7 would be considered highly correlated. That means that holding one is going to give you similar exposure to holding the other. Now, another metric that gold investors like to use is the gold-silver ratio. So, you simply take the price of an ounce of gold and divide it by the price of silver. And then that's a ratio that you can plot over time. So, when it spikes, that presumes that silver needs to catch up to gold. And then when it falls, that means silver is catching up to gold. And you can see this metric declining recently. That's because silver has been hitting new highs and attracting a lot of attention. and it's caused our premium subscribers to start asking some questions around this, which is why we're covering silver today. Now, they say that gold is like a 3:00 a.m. booty call. It only shines when everything else has fallen apart. But lately, both gold and silver have been shining despite the fact that we're still in a raging bull market. But this is very important. That's not why we're holding gold. It's not because we expect gold to outperform. It's very important to understand that. We hold it because of diversification effects. And again, Portfolio Visualizer, with this great correlation matrix. We used to have to put these together manually in B school. And here, you can see how weakly correlated gold is against these various benchmarks. Institutional investors often use gold as a tool for its diversification effects, and that's why we hold it. Now, here's where things get interesting. I didn't know this. So silver actually has, generally, a higher correlation to equities than gold. That means that it more closely aligns with the stock market, and the reason is very intuitive. That's because there are a lot more industrial use cases for silver than gold. So the diversification effect you get from holding silver is less than gold. And this past year, both metals have rallied strongly. So, if we look at performance real quick, you can see on the 5-year chart here, yes, over the past several years, both silver and gold have appreciated. You see, silver is outpacing gold. Both are beating the returns of the S&P 500. But then, when we take this out to 20 years, it really gets interesting. Gold has actually beaten the S&P 500 over the past 20 years, returning 521% versus the S&P 500 at 438%. Now, gold is often criticized. I believe Buffett would criticize gold and say, "Well, it doesn't actually do anything, right? It potentially costs money to store. It doesn't generate any sort of income." And an analogy I've always enjoyed is aliens looking down on our planet would see us digging up this shiny rock and spending all this money trying to find it and dig it out of the ground. Then we refine it a bit and then we put it back inside the ground in Fort Knox and guard it. So, what the hell are we even doing, right? It's a rock. A rock. A rock. Gold has no intrinsic value, really. It doesn't produce dividends or earnings. However, there's a lot of value, culturally, for gold, especially in places like India. You see here the usage of gold in jewelry. And only 7 to 10% of gold that's produced is used for industrial purposes. Contrast that to silver where 50 to 60% of all silver that's produced is used for industrial use cases. And the latest thesis that we've been seeing, this title says it all, right? The world is running out of silver and AI is accelerating the squeeze. Well, first of all, the world's not running out of silver. There is a mismatch between supply and demand. We're going to look at in a second, but industrial use cases certainly have increased. They were at an all-time high in 2024. And data centers are a driver of that because silver's used in the production of electronic equipment. Here's what's very interesting. I didn't know this either. Around 70% of silver, globally, is produced as a byproduct of producing other metals. So that starts to make things quite complex, right? Because that means you have to start producing, in 70% of the cases, other metals more if you want to increase the production of silver. So that makes it more difficult to respond to changes in demand, which, of course, is why you see the price appreciation. Demand has now exceeded supply for the past 5 years. And what happens when we see supply not meeting demand? Well, there's going to be more recycling, right? The price goes up. It makes it more lucrative to recycle. New exploration, of course, it takes quite a while to bring mines online. So there's certainly a lag there. You have technological advancements. Solar panels actually use quite a bit of silver, and now they're looking at different ways that they can reduce the volume of silver needed. It's called thrifting. There are efficiency improvements, of course, and price increases are going to drive all these factors, right? So, eventually then, you'll have supply meeting demand. This is just how basic economics work for commodities like gold and silver. Now you need to take this conversation to a higher level, to start out with. And start at the asset class allocation level and think about alternative asset class exposure. All right. So what percentage of my assets do I want in alternatives? So we're targeting roughly 10%. For us, our alternative assets would be gold. We have some Bitcoin, some wine, some art. In my mind, alternatives can also be things that you have a little bit of fun with, things that you enjoy, right? There's a lot of studies out there. Grok makes it super easy now, or whatever your favorite LLM is. Just go and ask it what research says, and it'll go out there and find key research papers and tell you what the findings are. Whilst many of these studies treat silver and gold differently, the combined recommendations say anywhere from 5 to 15%. And you can look at asset owners like Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund or Stanford's Fund, like large asset owners and how they do asset-class allocation and mimic that. Which alternatives do you find appealing? Right? If you're starting to think about investing in alternatives, you probably accumulated some wealth, you can have some fun with it. And holding gold, I don't know. This was several years ago. We were sort of thinking about that and saying, is there something more relevant? So we cover dividend growth stocks and disruptive growth stocks. Is there some alternative asset that's more relevant? Let's say investing in startups, right? We were thinking about that now that gold is appreciating rapidly, right? It becomes very difficult to start changing your alternative asset allocation strategy, right, when something's running. But at any rate, people are going to wonder, well, how should you hold gold or silver? I think holding physical bullion is a lot of fun, right? Taking out your little bag of gold coins. It's fun to hold physical bullion, right? Now, of course, you hold it in a safe or a lock box somewhere. You don't tell anyone about it. But if you can't do that, then you can consider an ETF like SLV, which charges 50 basis points. That's quite high, half a percent. Or you have SIVR, 30 basis points. We would always just choose the lowest-fee ETF. So for gold, we're paying 10 basis points for the SPDR Gold MiniShares ETF, right? That's really a good deal. We always look and choose the lowest-fee ETF. Now, miners just aren't compelling. A lot of people would probably disagree with that. That's because your exposure isn't so pure. You know, the idea, oh, I'm going to get, you know, leveraged returns on precious metals. Yeah, there's a lot of risk there. And generally speaking, the risks don't justify the rewards. Really, avoid anything relating to junior miners. Just a bad idea. Now, let's say you wanted to hold a basket of all precious metals, okay? Not just gold and silver. I found this, the abrdn Physical Precious Metals Basket. What they've done here is they're looking at market value and liquidity and coming up with weightings. And look how interesting this is. So 92% of this ETF would be in gold and silver. So there really isn't a need to go rooting around for that additional 8% exposure to Paladium or platinum, right? And if you wanted to invest in this basket, they're going to charge you 60 bips. That's way too much. So you could do this instead. So have your own weightings. Hold 65% in a gold ETF. As I said, SPDR Gold MiniShares at 10 bips. Hold 35% in a silver ETF. So, you can use the abrdn Physical Silver Shares ETF, charging 30 bips. You're paying a blended 17 bips. This isn't a bad idea, frankly, and we could do that in our own portfolio. But since these assets are highly correlated and gold gives you that additional diversification effect, I think we'll probably just stick with where we're at. Now, people might say, well, is silver going to benefit more with the AI boom? You could certainly make a case for that. But I don't think that's a compelling enough reason for us to switch our weightings because, again, we're primarily holding gold for the diversification effect from an asset allocation perspective. So, so silver and gold offer similar exposure profiles because they're highly correlated, and silver has more industrial use cases. So, it may stand to benefit more from the growth of AI. It's also more correlated to equities. So, from a diversification perspective, that's not so appealing. If you're all in on any precious metal, I think, you need to start thinking about diversifying over time into other asset classes. A great opportunity to do that. You're someone sitting on the sidelines. Think about alternative assets more holistically. No FOMO. And I think a blend of gold and silver might make sense, and physical bullion, if you can. Then you avoid fees entirely. And if you're going to invest in silver, invest from the perspective of an alternative asset, not just because of AI data center growth. That's just an incidental benefit, hopefully. Right? So I know some investors out there will be raising the question, well, there's other metals that you can invest in that will benefit from the growth of AI data centers. And one of those is copper. So we published this piece, this was in summer of last year, that looks at ways to invest in copper. Give that a watch next. Thanks so much for taking the time to watch this video today.
