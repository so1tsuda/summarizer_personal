Robo-advisors like Betterment, Wealthfront, Vanguard, and Schwab now manage over $2 trillion in assets. Maybe you're using one of these services and you're wondering if it's worth paying for. Are you leaving money on the table? Which of these robo-advisors is best? What does robo mean anyway? Today's presentation is chock full of information about robo-advisors that you need to know. So, we've been covering robo-advisors now for over a decade. We've even worked with some of them in the past. And the name robo-advisor implies some sort of AI usage when that's actually not really the case. The recipe-driven approach that most robo-advisers take is quite simple. You may be familiar with the 100 minus your age rule. That simply says that you take 100 minus your age and that's how much money you ought to have in equities and the rest in bonds. As time goes on, of course, as you age, the ratio of money going into bonds increases. That's often called a glide path. And what you're doing there is you're gradually shifting your asset allocation from more risky assets to less risky assets, bonds, over time. As you get closer to retirement, you want to reduce volatility. So a robo-advisor roughly does the same thing. It automatically configures your allocations as you age. And the real value ad for robo-advisors was that they were going to be a lower fee alternative to human advisors. This table here was actually taken from a piece that we did. I think this was eight years ago looking at robo-advisors AI and asset allocation. And we had made the remark here that these are really the same sort of tools that private wealth managers use except now they're stuffed into the cloud and automated so that anybody can access them. And when we think about the $2 trillion that robo-advisers are managing, it's always important to put numbers into context. So whilst that sounds very large, it actually isn't. So when you look at global assets under management, so this would be money that's being managed by third parties, the value of that is now close to $150 trillion. So robo-advisors manage about 2 trillion. That's about the same amount of money that Edward Jones manages. However, it's less than 2% of total wealth being managed. However, if you multiply that, let's say, by 30 basis points, perhaps the average fee being charged by a robo adviser, you get a run rate of about $6 billion. So, there's a lot of money to be made there. And we can look at this report by Morningstar, which looks at robo-advisors in 2025. The executive summary here talks about how the great robo-advisor disruption never arrived. So, it was anticipated that robo-advisors would replace human advisers. Well, that never really worked out. And this is pretty remarkable here. It says just one pure robo-advisor remains that does not offer some person-to-person counsel with its algorithmic guidance. What this ended up turning into is really just a lead magnet to attract assets so that then they can upsell their clients personal advisor services. So really, we've just gone full circle and Morningstar here talks about how for young investors with uncomplicated financial situations, robo-advisors can be good starting places. Well, not when you have an environment now fueled by fintwats and social media where everybody's pushed towards high-risk options and prediction markets and things like that. So whilst it may be good for young investors, I don't think a lot of them are availing themselves of these tools. And when you look at a robo-advisor like Betterment here, you can see they're talking about how self-directed investing is here. Again, going full circle. The idea was that it wouldn't be self-directed, that you would let these algorithms dictate your asset allocation. And now they're saying, well, you can be self-directed. They're really trying to be everything to everyone. And that sort of defeats the original purpose of robo-advisors. And here I've provided a table generated by Grok, which looks at the top robo-advisor by assets under management. And there's a couple takeaways here. So, first of all, you're going to get different numbers depending on where you look, but the leader by far would be Vanguard. Rather remarkable. $333 billion in assets under management. And of course, they offer some of the lowest fees out there. You would expect that from Vanguard. That's their reputation, low fees, right? Then you have Schwab here. Now, Schwab's done a great job of offering a lot of low-fee products, but they talk about here, no advisory fee. Well, there's no such thing as a free lunch, right? So, we're going to look into that. And then there's Wealthfront, which is actually having an IPO. And that gives us an inside look into the mechanics of a robo-advisor, and we're going to talk about whether or not that would be something you'd want to invest in. So, when we look at Schwab, you see here, no advisory fee charge. They compare themselves to other robo-advisors. And then when you dig into the mechanics, of course, you complete these questionnaires so they can assess your risk tolerance. It also takes into account your age. And then you're given a diversified portfolio of ETFs. Well, those ETFs, of course, are charging fees. So there is no such thing as a free lunch. And when you look at the assessment of Schwab's offering by Morningstar, this is rather interesting. So technically, Schwab could not charge fees at all and simply make money on the cash that they're holding. And they talk here about how Schwab's intelligent portfolios make excessive cash allocations. You need to be careful there because there's a lot of incentive for Schwab to hold that cash. And we're going to look at why that is when we take a closer look at Wealthfront, which realizes 75% of their revenues coming off of cash management. And they talk here about how cash can be a drag on returns. Well, really, when it comes to returns, this is a moot point. You need to focus on fees. So when you look at this collateral here, I think this is from Betterment talking about how since they launched their core portfolio, it's delivered over 9%. Yeah. So roughly what the stock market has delivered. That's what you expect, right? You provided market performance. So what? That's what your clients would expect. So, when you're looking to choose a robo-advisor, don't pay attention to what they say their performance is. Focus on fee structures, which will differ by account sizes. So, typically the larger the account, the smaller the fees that you're paying. But remember that the company managing the most assets is going to have the most flexibility when it comes to offering the lowest fees. And that's Vanguard. They've built their entire brand based on being the lowcost leader. It's no surprise at all that they're ranked highest by Morningstar. I think three out of the past four years they've been ranked highest. But I noticed the footnote was quite interesting. They said, compensation provided for use of the rating and marketing materials. So Morningstar rates them and then they have to pay Morningstar to put that in their market materials. It's rather shifty, but I think when you read this report by Morningstar, it all makes sense. It comes down to fees. So, what you can do is go over to Vanguard's site and calculate the cost or they don't call it a robo-advisor anymore. They call it a digital advisor. You plug in the amount of money that you're going to invest in it. It tells you what you're going to pay. So, I would say if you're going to pay 20 basis points for an asset allocation glide path of the type that Vanguard is providing, just do it yourself with Fidelity Zero products and don't pay any fees at all. A major reason why people have financial advisors is for emotional support. This was taken from a piece we did that looked at financial advisors and why people hire them. And emotion-based reasons make up the majority of reasons why they're being hired. And that's because when the stock market starts crashing or a stock starts falling, that's when everybody starts asking questions. Whenever there's a market correction, we get inundated with emails from people who want assurance. They get that from financial advisors. One would hope they do, right? You should stay the course. That's typically what a financial adviser would tell you. So, what you can do then is pay Vanguard a little bit extra and get a personal advisor. So, you should always be looking at fees that you're paying, divided by the money that you're giving them. So, simple math shows that for a personal adviser, you have to, I think, have at least 50k. That's going to be 35 basis points. That's reasonable. Compare that to Edward Jones, which is going to charge you 1% upfront. And then, of course, hefty fees on the products that they push you towards. Right? What I really like about this is it explains it very clearly. The most you'll pay. And then when you look at the mechanics here, well, they're saying, "All right, we're going to refund the fees that you're paying for the products we push you towards." And that goes against that fee. So the most you're ever going to pay is 35 basis points. Now, when it comes to the future of robo-advisors, it doesn't look all that promising to be honest. I like this timeline that can be found in that Morningstar report and it looks at the various large firms out there that dabbled. What's remarkable is it took less than six years for Vanguard to simply dominate this space. So, back when we first started looking at robo-advisors, they weren't even playing, and now they're by far the biggest leader. Took Goldman five years, less than 5 years, to decide robo-advisors weren't for them. JP Morgan also shuttered their offering on weak demand. So that brings us to the Wealthfront IPO. So this was announced, I think, in September, and only recently got around to looking at the S1. Not missing a whole lot, but certainly some interesting information here. So first of all, they talk about $88 billion in assets under management. Well, that's different from the numbers we looked at before, and that's because they're breaking out cash management from investment advisory fees. So, if we take the money they're managing, $42 billion, we multiply that by 25 bips, we get $105 million. Well, when we look at their actual revenues, investment advisory is a lot less. But here is what's remarkable. Cash management makes up 75% of their revenues. So, the lion's share of money they're making comes from interest that they're receiving from cash balances that they're holding for their clients. So this is potentially problematic. So if they shift that from cash management to investments, presumably they're going to make less. But what will really have them making less is when interest rates continue to drop. So this doesn't bode well for their business. When we look at the future of robo-advisors, I think Morningstar says it best. Few digital advisers, robo-advisors, whatever you want to call them, rely solely on computer algorithms. They're now starting to look more like the firms that they were trying to disrupt. Again, we're coming full circle. Nearly all digital advisers now offer some human counsel, but they continue to compete on cost and new features. So, that's good for customers. Morningstar says that none of these digital advisers foresee using AI to generate recommendations yet because they're fearful of things like hallucinations. But when you consider that this is simply an asset allocation exercise, how much real value is AI going to add anyway? So this conclusion, of course, that digital advisers, robo advisers have supplemented rather than supplanted traditional advisor. So the big question, should you use a robo-advisor? Well, if you can't be asked to deal with asset allocation decisions yourself, then sure. But if you don't need human contact, just create your own glide path using Fidelity Zero. And think long and hard about paying for human contact. How often are you going to use that, right? So make sure that you're getting, as we talked about in our financial advisor piece, you're getting sufficient value and you understand all the fees you're paying. That's why we like Vanguard, right? Transparency. They're the only robo-adviser we would consider. So they have the assets under management to truly compete on price. Their fee structure is transparent with this will-not-exceed structure. Also, this isn't a binary decision. You could allocate some of your assets to a robo-advisor and then use that as a benchmark. Now, when it comes to Wealthfront's IPO, I don't think investing in that seems like a great idea. Remains to be seen what the stock price does, but the company isn't attractive for the reasons that we talked about. What happens when interest rates fall? So, I'm sure a fair number of you out there have financial advisors. I think it's very important that you understand the value that you're getting. So, you ought to watch this piece next. It's probing the sort of questions you ought to be asking your financial advisor. So, give that a watch next. Thanks so much for taking the time to watch this today.
