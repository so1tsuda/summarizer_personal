When my favorite stock goes up, it's because of my Nostradamus-like investing acumen, when my favorite stock falls, it's the market's fault. Well, IonQ has been falling a lot lately, which has some investors asking why. The answer is quite simple. It's the market. I'm joking, of course. It's because the value of the business doesn't match the current stock price. Today, we're going to look at everything Ionq has been up to. And throughout this, you'll learn a lot about investing in quantum computing. I'll also answer one question that you all haven't stopped asking. Why quantum computing? Well, quantum computers can solve problems that classical computers can't. So, here's a simple example. Your typical UPS driver, the UPS man, makes an average of 135 deliveries daily. The number of possible routes they could take is so large that you'd have to describe it with 227 digits. It would take a classical computer longer than the age of the universe to calculate the true optimal route for a driver. What they call the traveling salesman problem. UPS would need to do this for more than 66,000 routes daily. So basically, a quantum computer could solve all those route problems and save the company a lot of money. And of course, this space is only starting out. I'm going to refer to this report by McKinsey. It's an excellent one throughout today's presentation. And this first slide shows how, in the current year, the total amount of revenue generated from quantum computing is going to be about a billion dollars. So, let's say IonQ has $110 million this year in revenues. What they're roughly expecting, well, that would give them about 11% market share. And there are all these grandiose estimates of how much potential market share there is to capture. They seem credible. Though quantum computing, to be fair, has always been 5 years away for as long as I can remember. Now, we first looked at IonQ about four years ago. We had favorable things to say about the company. We found the founders to be quite accomplished. That usually means they'll be able to attract the best talent in that space. They expected to deliver a rack-mounted quantum computer by 2023. Talk of the world's most powerful quantum computer. And we said that we only wanted to see progress in the form of revenue growth. Well, perhaps we spoke a bit too soon because not all types of revenue growth are created equal. When we look at where the founders are today, they seem to have bailed for a career in Academia. And in February of this year, you saw the CEO and CFO change. That's not good. and the gentleman who stepped in as CEO at that time is now the Chairman of the Board. And when you have a CEO who is also the chairman of the board, that's a conflict of interest, it's frowned upon by those who assess governance in corporations. But there are really two interpretations to be had here. The first would be that the old management team sucked, so they were shown the door. That's because they missed their spack deck target so badly. And of course, the new management team is going to make everything right. Or you might say that the founders bailed because they didn't see the promise in the company, at least the core product offering that they were showcasing at the time they had their SPAC. And all this management churn that we see indicates a poorly company as typically is the case. Just today, actually, they lost their Chief Revenue Officer. Who knows why? So let's just move past that and start looking at revenue growth. So, of course, their glossy spack deck made promises they couldn't keep. They were expecting $237 million for this year. They're now expecting instead about $108 million at the midpoint of guidance. Now, this still represents very strong revenue growth. And we'd ask, well, where is that coming from? Is this revenue coming from their core platform, the one that they showcased in their SPAC, or is it coming from a lot of acquisitions that the company has been making lately? Well, the answer, of course, is acquisitions during 2025. They made five different acquisitions. And it's so apparent here in the balance sheet. Just look at the sharp increase in intangible assets and goodwill. So basically, goodwill is when you go to acquire a company and you can't account for all the money that you're paying for what you're receiving. So you simply put that in a bucket and say, "Oh, that's goodwill." That's future value. We're going to realize later because this is such a great acquisition. What it typically means is that you overpaid. Now, they're going to argue that they overpaid for good reason. And the explanation for that comes from this diagram that McKinsey put forth that shows how Quantum technology is really three major components. You have Quantum Computing, what we're all familiar with. Then you have Quantum Communication and Quantum Sensing. And when you move to IonQ's slide in their recent investor deck, you see here they describe themselves as the only quantum platform company in the world. And they're touching on all these areas, right? And that sort of makes sense when you look at who they acquired. So they acquired a company called ID Quantique. We covered them I think it was six years ago and looked at their hardware and they dabbled in Quantum Security and Quantum Communication Services. So it would make sense that IonQ would acquire them to fill those gaps in their offering. And here you can see a list of the acquisitions that were made in 2025. It appears to be six different names. And I wanted to focus on three of these. So we talked about ID Quantique. You can check our past piece to learn more about what they do. Then we have Oxford Ionics. So they're dabbling in trapped ion technology, which is what ion dabbles in. And, of course, the easy-to-understand thesis would be that they've simply acquired a competitor so they can accelerate their development efforts. And that's particularly important because they have a very formidable competitor. We're going to talk about a little bit later. And then there was the acquisition that I really had to take a second look at because it didn't really seem to make sense. So Capella Space and, of course, the story is that Capella's technology will be used as a basis for their Quantum Space hardware. They're ultimately going to sell to other satcom firms, right? And their executive chairman at the time makes this statement. He says, "Capella has an application today which is revenue generating." Yeah, it's generating revenues, but these aren't quantum revenues. their plan for turning this into a quantum play comes down the road. He goes on to talk about a platform with bulletproof space heritage. Yeah, remember that. So, I guess the question here is how much revenue are we talking about? Because if it's a lot, then the pure playness, if you will, of IonQ just dropped meaningfully. And we can turn to this firm called LatkaAI. They talk about how Capella Space hit $74 million in revenue in 2023. Well, that would be roughly 70% of the revenues that IonQ is guiding for this year. But, of course, that number was back in 2023. And when you look at this comment made in an earnings call by IonQ, they talk about how they're now going to own and operate a proliferated constellation of low Earth orbit satellites that they plan to outfit with quantum stuff. Well, when you continue reading this article by Payload, it's rather telling. So, in 2023, the same year they had the supposed $73 million in revenues, the company suffered propulsion problems that led its satellites to decay faster than expected. Apparently, the founding CEO stepped down that fall. And in this story, they talk about how the number of Capella spacecraft in orbit right now would be four following two deorbits in March and May of 2025. So, there's a really good question to ask here. What has IonQ actually purchased? If they purchased $73 million in revenues, they just diluted their quantum exposure a lot. They're now dabbling in something very different from the quantum work, the core quantum work that we all signed up for in that SPAC deck. And if they didn't, if the revenues fell dramatically because half the satellites fell out of the sky, we're falling right out of the sky. Then it sounds like they purchased a failed business. Which is it? This just sounds like a typical SPAC playbook, right? You raise a bunch of money by making grandiose promises that you realize you can't keep. Then you take your cash windfall and start buying companies with it. You're bolting on that revenue growth. And exactly what sort of bargains are you hoping to acquire when you're operating during a time when there's a lot of quantum hype. Investors who are selling their quantum companies are going to want a premium, which is why we see such a large goodwill balance on their balance sheet. Rarely does this strategy work out as planned. And for those of you that think it will, you're going to pay a pretty price to participate. So, before I start talking about valuation, I wanted to address a question that we've been getting a lot lately about the elephant in the room. Why have I been shooting videos from an ancient temple in the Japanese mountains? Okay, nobody asked. I just wanted to talk about it. So, as you might know, our Romanian fortune teller recently submitted her resignation letter, which means we're scrambling to find alternative sources of alpha. One possible source, you guessed it, Buddhism. And the population of Japan is declining. So, you get more karma for your dollar. So, I'd like to extend a big Arigato Gozaimas to every premium subscriber who recently participated in our customer focus survey. We're going to be debuting a very cool enhancement soon, so stay tuned for that. Anywho, back to talking about IonQ. So, when we look at the current valuation of this company, it's somewhere around $15 billion. We can then use a price-to-sales ratio because these companies don't have profit. So, you can't use your typical price-to-earnings ratio, right? So, we have expected sales for 2025 of $108 million and we'll just use that number, and we get a value of 137. So we need something to benchmark that against. I've pulled up our tech stock catalog here and I simply filtered on the companies with the highest what we call simple valuation ratio. So we take market cap and divide it by annualized revenues, not forecasted revenues. And here you can see that, what we call, the simple valuation ratio or SVR. You can see that calculated along with their average over the past year. And then we have a premium or a discount. Kind of cool, right? So you can see well Robinhood has just gone through the roof in terms of their valuation. Same thing for Rocket Lab and, of course, Palantir. Now, if you took the average of all the companies that we calculate this for, it's somewhere around 7.5. Our cutoff is three times that. So let's say around 22. We just don't buy companies that are richer than that. And compared to these other companies, IonQ is extremely overvalued. So what you can then do, this is rather fun, is you can back out the share price based on what sorts of valuations it ought to trade at. So let's say it traded at the same valuation Palantir did, well that would be about $31 a share. If it traded at the same valuation as Rocket Lab, that would be $14 a share. And if it traded at our cutoff, roughly around 22, that would be just under $7 a share. So this firm is extremely overvalued and even IonQ agrees. You go back to their SPAC deck, when they're talking about valuation here, they use a 10 times to 15 times revenue multiple. They knew not to use a 100 times revenue multiple because even Joe Retail, well maybe not DGen Joe Retail, but even a retail investor with a small amount of investing acumen would realize that's absolutely ridiculous. And here you can see their ridiculous valuation over time. We've plotted this over about a year and a half. You can see how it went from floating around the 30s to, sort of, getting up there close to 200. But right now it's, as I said, floating around the mid-130s mark. So what we usually say to investors is if you're going to set a valuation target, you should always have one. If you're dabbling in the volatile world of tech stocks, what you can do is take the last four values, average them, and set that as your target. Well, that's not going to work so well here, right? Because this is persistently traded at such a rich valuation for such a long period of time. Two things will happen. Fundamentals will catch up or the valuation will revert to the mean. This isn't controversial. This is simply how markets work. You have to be careful about a lot of the flowery language they use. Of course, here they're talking about delivering the world's most powerful quantum computer. I thought they already had that. Maybe it's this special one with 2 million cubits by 2030. Folks, it's always five years away, right? Well, maybe this time it's different. Could very well be, with all the money being poured into quantum computing. But one expert I spoke with said that when companies start talking about cubits, that's like a car being advertised with a price tag where you can't see what the mileage is, right? So without key additional information, that means next to nothing. I think Joe Retail has a tendency to think that quantum computing is simply the four stonks that he sees shooting to the moon every day. But you see here IBM's press release this past summer. They expect to debut the first largecale fault tolerant. That's very important for anybody that understands the problems that they're facing in this space. The first fault-tolerant quantum computer. It's projected to run 20,000 times more operations than today's quantum computers. The one thing noticeable here is the approach they're taking where they use logical cubits which are built on top of physical cubits, and that's supposed to solve the error correction problems. And you see other firms are taking this approach as well, from the McKinsey report. Some of the world's biggest tech companies are dabbling here. You've got Google, Amazon, Microsoft, right? IBM. And this next slide is very nice. It breaks down the approaches taken by various companies. And look here to the right. You have trapped ions. There's IonQ. There's another company called AQT. I think they're out of Switzerland and Continuum. So that's the Honeywell spin-off. That's one you should really be watching closely. And then you go over here through the left and then you can see the other various approaches being taken. But when you look at funding, and there's a lot of it going into quantum startups. And this chart, of course, taken from the McKinsey report needs to be updated with this little factoid. So, Continuum has now a valuation of $10 billion following a $600 million raise they did just several months ago. That doubled their valuation from the $5 billion it was earlier last year. And, of course, NVIDIA's invested. Well, what isn't NVIDIA invested in? Doesn't mean a whole lot, right? They have so much cash. But some of these other names are notable. Of course, Honeywell, you have JP Morgan, Chase, and Mitsui. So it's likely that these investors see something very promising with Continuum which is a direct competitor to IonQ. So let's sort of ignore statements that IonQ says here. I noted one in particular. "We can confidently state that in almost every case beyond IonQ, it's just a branding attempt." Really? So all 270 quantum computing startups out there, they're all branding attempts, right? None of them are doing anything legitimate? Certainly, it's a red flag when you have C-suite types saying ridiculous things, and IonQ seems to be saying no shortage of ridiculous things. Though, of course, the bull thesis that they're proposing, right, is compelling on paper, and they now have a whole bunch of cash. So this year they raised, I guess, $3 billion. They have $3.5 billion in their balance sheet now. And when they talk about what they're going to use it for now, they talk about investing in R&D. Well, they've spent an awful lot of money on R&D. I think $200 million for the first 9 months of this year. What exactly are they building if they're having to acquire everything? Let's say, well, we're integrating everything together. Okay. So, once you get done with all these purchases, what's the growth rate going to look like then? That's very key piece of information. Well, what might happen here is they're going to take this $3.5 billion and they're just going to keep acquiring, right? It's not necessarily a good thing at all. So nearly every response that's going to be critical of our analysis will have some sort of FOMO variation to it. This time it's different in reference to the valuation. No, it's not. There is no rush at all here. And I like this table here. So what do Space Nuclear and Quantum Computing stocks have in common? Well, the answer is DGEN. So all of the stocks that you see here on this list are overvalued and being hyped very heavily. And look how they move in unison. There almost seems to be a sort of correlation happening here. And that correlation, of course, is DGEN behavior. Be very careful out there. So we're going to check back in a year to see if the valuation is more reasonable and if these acquisitions have stopped. So then we can get an idea of what this collective company looks like going forward and what sort of guidance they're giving on this new grand platform that they've built. And in the meantime, other companies might see all this money being thrown at publicly traded Quantum firms and want to get in on the action. And of course, that's happening. There's a new Quantum Computing IPO that's coming. We analyzed that for you in this recent piece. Give that a watch next. Thanks so much for taking the time to watch this video today.
