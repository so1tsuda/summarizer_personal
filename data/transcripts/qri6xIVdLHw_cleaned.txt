Tech investor Marc Andreessen, says that artificial intelligence is about to make everything so cheap that it's going to break the economy. Amazon now runs over $520,000 AI-powered robots in its fulfillment centers. Walmart saves roughly $1.5 billion a year with AI-driven inventory management. And Maersk has cut vessel idle time by 30% using AI. Now, these all sound like good things, but experts have been warning that this is going to lead to massive deflation. What if that happens? How would your portfolio be impacted? Is deflation good or bad? I'm going to answer all those questions today using simple terms. So, let's get started. Now, the prices of things go up over time consistently. It's called inflation. And the generally accepted average for inflation is 3% a year. So the stock market returns about 9% per year and inflation at 3% nullifies some of those gains. So that means that the real returns for the stock market are about 6% per year, adjusted for inflation. When the rate of inflation goes up, the price of goods goes up. That becomes more noticeable. People start to complain. And everyone in the USA right now is complaining about the prices of goods going up. So are they actually going up? Well, we use a metric called the Consumer Price Index to measure this over time. It's a widely accepted metric that economists use to gauge the rate of inflation. And as you can see here, it's about 3%. And there's a number of categories here. You see Food and Energy, and these all other items bucket, which is quite a lot more elaborate than I thought. And you can Google this and go look at the data yourself. But you can see here they provide a table that shows the rate of inflation for every single subcategory. And there's actually a geographic structure and an item structure. Here you can see there are eight major groups and some examples of the categories that can be found in each group. So there's a lot of stuff being measured here. And when we look at that rate of inflation over time, you can see from May 2008 till July 2008 that inflation was increasing. So it peaked there at about 5% and then it started falling. So the rate of inflation was falling year-over-year. That's called disinflation. So the rate at which inflation increases slows. And then you can see when the rate of inflation actually goes negative. That means that prices are cheaper than they were a year ago. That's called deflation. And it's actually not a good thing. But the good thing about deflation is that it doesn't last very long. And here we've zoomed out. This is a great chart. Simple. Shows the rate of inflation from 2005 until 2025. And the gray on the chart shows the recession between 2007 to 2009, which was very dramatic. That's when I started my career on Wall Street. Everything was all scary and you can see that short period of deflation. And then when you look more to the right, you see that other gray line that represents the brief COVID 19 recession. I don't think you could really call that even a recession, but they do. And then you can see now that inflation has settled around 3%, it's sort of around the average. Now when we look at historical precedents for deflation, the most dramatic deflationary period in US history was actually the Great Depression. It was between 1930 and 1933. The second most dramatic deflationary period was the 2007 and 2009 period referred to by economists as the Great Recession. And during both of these events, unemployment spiked dramatically. Okay. Now, was it the unemployment that created the deflation? In other words, fewer people are buying goods, the demand dropped, so prices drop. Or was it that deflation, the prices dropping, resulted in unemployment? Well, it's largely believed that recessions caused both deflation and unemployment. However, this time they're expecting deflation to be caused by the most disruptive technology of our time, artificial intelligence. It's largely believed that the dramatic AI efficiencies that we're seeing, such as the examples given at the beginning of this presentation, are going to cause the price of things to drop dramatically. Now, you could argue here that the big bad corporations are going to be taking these excess profits and that the price cuts will never be passed on to the consumers, but that's really oversimplifying things. But let's go ahead and assume that corporations are going to become enormously profitable from the use of AI for automation. How can we measure that? Well, there's a metric called Corporate Profits as a percentage of GDP and it's already at historical highs. So, companies, as you can see in this chart, are already highly profitable. Now, this is from 1940 to 2024, but the most recent measurement is around 11%. So, it roughly lines up with what this chart shows you. And again, the gray bars are showing us recessions. And what this would tell us is that the rich forward price to earnings ratios that you see out there, let's say on average they're rich, right? Those can be justified based on the expectations of all the efficiencies that are going to be created. But there's some big concerns around that because, turns out, AI isn't coming for the 3Ds, the dirty, dull, and dangerous jobs. It's coming for white collar jobs. So the impact is going to be far more pronounced since these folks have much higher purchasing power right now. High unemployment leads to deflation because it causes a decrease in overall spending which puts a downward pressure on prices. This can create what they call a deflationary cycle where lower demand leads to lower prices which causes businesses to cut wages or layoff workers. Make a note of the layoffs. We're going to talk about that in a second. And the cycle keeps getting worse and worse. Now, indeed, some of this appears to be happening. And this recent article by CNBC raised some eyebrows. So, job cuts in October hit their highest level for the month in 22 years. There's this firm called Challenger. They monitor this stuff over time. It's all rather interesting. You ought to pop open the report and take a look at it. Or actually, I'll do that for you. Show you some of the more interesting parts. So they said that this is now the worst year for layoffs since 2009, right? The great recession. And they say this is because a disruptive technology is changing the landscape. So you can see this table here. The first four columns show each quarter for the given years. And the last column there simply sums them. And through October of this year, employers have announced over a million job cuts. This is an increase of 65% from the first 10 months of last year. And when you look at 2007 and 2008, you see these large job cuts that happened. And then of course in 2020, the pandemic, right, brought out a bunch of job cuts during that short-lived recession. And now we're on track to exceed a million, perhaps hit the numbers that we were at in 2008 and 2009. Now, you can contrast these numbers to the total unemployed people, which as of August 2025 in the United States was around 7.38 million. So you're simply adding to that number and there are of course folks that will get rehired but that might start to become difficult because there aren't going to be that many open jobs with AI creating so many efficiencies. Now one thing to note about these numbers is when you dig into them you see that there's actually a root cause here that is only recently arrived and that is DOGE. So if you look at the layoff location you see District of Columbia. Look at how dramatic that is. So, you had what 35,000 job cuts year-to-date in 2024 and over 300,000 year-to-date this year. And the other thing that backs this up is when you look at the leading reason for job cut announcements in 2025, it's DOGE Impact. And look at this. Very cool. They provide a breakdown of the job cuts by reason. So, Doge is sort of a one-off, right? That's the US government's attempt to create efficiencies in the government. Then of course the second leading cause here, market economic conditions, the old macroeconomic headwinds blowing stuff right and then look further down the list, you have artificial intelligence. Now if you're going out and aggregating all this data, companies aren't going to be coming right out and saying well AI created all these efficiencies necessarily because there's going to start to be public backlash around that. So whilst they want to let investors know, hey, we're using AI and creating all these efficiencies, they have to be very careful there because then when they talk about job cuts relating to AI, and people aren't going to find that so palatable. And interestingly enough, there's a new bipartisan bill that would require companies to report AI job losses. I only wonder how effective that's going to be when you think about how corporate America operates. There's a lot of ways that you can spin job cuts without having to put them into this bucket. I don't know what you would do with this information necessarily. Perhaps it would just reinforce the fact that AI is taking a whole bunch of jobs. Now, we've talked about this before and perhaps one of the biggest concerns that we have around AI is the impact of very high levels of unemployment coming off the back of all these efficiencies being created. You can only retool people so much. And I think that you'll probably see the effects of this start to manifest themselves in overseas locations where people are less likely to complain. Think Manila and Mumbai, right? Large offshoring centers will be hit quite hard. Maybe it would be interesting to look at unemployment numbers over there. But for right now, we're interested in what's happening in our own backyard. And here you can see that recessions, as I said before, always create unemployment. And this unemployment manifests itself with very dramatic spikes. And when we look at an unemployment in this five-year range, we see it slowly increasing and one wonders if that's going to start increasing at a higher rate because it's going to be more difficult finding a job once you're laid off. So just some thoughts here. They say that you should study economics because when you inevitably end up in the employment line, at least you'll understand why you're there. Economics is one of the few professions where you can talk about money without ever having to make any money. They say it's the only field where two economists can win the Nobel Prize for saying exactly the opposite thing. Economists also create a lot of noise. I think for retail investors, the minimum information you ought to know is inflation. You ought to understand how that works because it's very important when it comes to planning. the simple rule that your purchasing power halves every 30 years. That's pretty important. So if you're on a fixed income and you're 65 years old, by the time you get to 95 years old, your quality of life is halve that's not very good, right? That's not the golden years that you were promised. So I think that having a basic understanding of economic indicators lets you understand financial news, hold better conversations. I certainly admire economists for their ability to analyze the market in a manner that's actually quite sophisticated. There are a lot of moving parts, a lot of variables becomes very difficult to navigate in a hurry. So we summarize so far. Inflation is probably one of the most important metrics for retail investors to understand, as is disinflation, right? And deflation. Right now the rate of inflation seems to be about average. it's sort of flatlined. And that means that goods are constantly getting more expensive over time, just at a slower pace. Let's say an average pace. However, when goods become cheaper over time, these short-lived events have largely surrounded economic turmoil. You have to be very careful you don't fall into the deflationary cycle we talked about. So obviously the question is how does this impact your portfolio? And the question you might ask there is, well, what assets act as a hedge during deflationary periods? We already know that the stock market's going to be performing horribly during periods of high unemployment and deflation, right? What assets don't perform horribly? Well, obviously cash is the simplest hedge against deflation because cash is really strengthening in terms of the amount of goods that you can buy with it, right? And of course, investment bonds. So bond prices rise as interest rates fall and they're falling right now, right? Central banks are often prone to cut rates to combat deflation, so high quality fixed rate bonds would be a good hedge. There's a lot of reasons to own bonds. You know, people always joke, well, this is return-free risk. Yeah. Well, it's part of a well diversified portfolio, and this becomes more important as you age. And even for younger people, this is going to help reduce the extent to which you see your assets draw down during recessionary periods, which can be very difficult for some to manage. As you know, people feel the pain of losses twice as much as they feel the enjoyment of gains. And I think that in a market where most of the younger investors today have never felt pain, that perhaps the pain is three times as much. And then here they talk about defensive stocks with strong dividend histories. That leans right into our Quantigence strategy which focuses solely on companies with strong dividend histories. They say here cash-rich companies with low debt thrive. That's because if you're holding debt in a deflationary period, that's not a good thing. And then when it comes to gold, right, through traditional safe haven, results vary. Now, inevitably, somebody will bring up, you know, digital gold, Bitcoin, which doesn't have a history that's long enough for us to do proper correlation analysis, but certainly that's an alternative asset class, and those can be useful to hold as well in small quantities. So, what to do? Well, you probably watched this video because you're concerned about something bad happening. Now, from our perspective, we're pretty entrenched in those assets I just talked about. So, we're not very worried about any sort of deflation or recession that's coming up. We sleep very well at night. Now, what happens when people get worried, and I see this all the time, is they get tempted to modify their investment strategies in response to market events. I can't tell you how many people talked about going to cash during Trump's tariff drama. Don't react to market events. Have a strategy that you apply regardless of what the market is doing. Probably the most important thing to be watching here is whether AI is going to threaten your income, your job. Now, we covered that in this next video which talks about which jobs will likely be replaced by AI. You should give that a watch next. Thanks so much for taking the time to watch this today.
