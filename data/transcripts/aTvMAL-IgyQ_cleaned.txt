Investors have been going bananas over the nuclear energy AI trade, but they may be missing out on something much bigger. While everyone's waiting for the nuclear buildout, it's only 5 years away now, companies are turning to other sources of energy. Elon Musk just built one of the largest and fastest built data centers ever, and he used natural gas to power it. Many of today's largest data centers are using natural gas and experts think it's only just beginning. Is natural gas getting ready to boom on the back of the AI trade? We'll answer that question. And we'll also let you in on a little known stock that's working with Musk and X AI on their data center energy needs. So this chart by Goldman Sachs shows just how much energy is going to be needed for the massive data center buildouts that are happening. And famed tech investor Andreessen Horowitz just did a really interesting two-part series on everything you need to know about the US natural gas industry that's powering AI. Now that's not hyperbole. That's actually happening in front of the meter and behind the meter. So in front of the meter, this would actually be utility scale generation. So the power companies we're all familiar with, their transmission infrastructure etc. Then you have behind the meter, which is commercial and residential energy storage. So if you look at the state of California, for example, behind the meter, all those solar installations they have are said, by the California Energy Commission, to only have displaced around 10% of front of the meter electricity from utilities. So that's still quite a small chunk even in a solar-rich state like California because most behind the meter is actually solar. The largest chunk of front-of-the-meter is actually natural gas. Here you can see where that's broken down. So this was from 2023, but the numbers are still largely the same. These ratios you have fossil fuels, nuclear, and, of course, renewables. And look under there. Fossil fuels. 43% of electricity generation in the United States comes from natural gas. By far the largest source. Now, there's really two main reasons for this. First is, and I was again surprised to find this out, the US is the largest producer of natural gas in the world. And there's three US regions that produce more natural gas than most countries. You can see those spelt out here in this very nice diagram. Natural gas is actually one of the cheapest forms of energy. When it comes to generating electricity, we always point to Lazard's levelized cost of energy, which takes into account things like subsidies. And you see the two cheapest here, what they refer to as conventional generation. You have gas-combined cycle and US nuclear. And gas-combined cycle is the cheapest form of energy. So then you would expect that to be the most economical. Now, of course, there's a sensitivity there to fuel prices, natural gas. And this great chart again by Lazard shows that sensitivity, and it's not that meaningful, but it's certainly something that's worth considering when you look at the price of natural gas over time. This great chart simply plots that out over the past 10 years. The big spike that you see there in 2022, that's primarily due to the supply shock from Russia, the second largest producer of natural gas when they invaded Ukraine. That was the impact on the price of natural gas. And you can see it's making new highs, and we're going to talk about, perhaps, why that is. Now, this piece that was commissioned by Andreessen and written by this gentleman here who, I suppose, has given his job some sort of a vested interest in natural gas. So, you need to take what he says with a grain of salt, but it's a very informative piece. And it talks about how solar is not going to be the most effective tool to solve the AI energy crisis as much as Musk would like it to be. Down the road perhaps, but right now it isn't. And he's saying that we need to start building out more natural gas energy production right now or we're going to end up doing that down the road anyway. This great chart, you see the yellow, this is the daily power-generation stack and it shows when power becomes available. And of course, solar power is only available when the sun shines. So then you need all this expensive infrastructure to store the energy and to transmit it when the sun isn't shining. That increases the cost of solar significantly. Along the bottom there, you see nuclear. That always stays the same, right? And then you have red there which is natural gas which of course has to respond to a certain extent to the availability of electricity from other intermittent sources such as solar. And when we look at where the largest data centers are being powered from, the sources of energy, it's natural gas. Here you can see again a great chart by Andreessen showing data centers in various countries and the methods of electricity generation they're using, the largest there, using gas. Now, going to the grid isn't the answer for immediate expansion for obvious reasons, right? Everybody's complaining about their electricity prices going up because all the data centers are moving into the neighborhood. Behind the meter is the answer. So, that's really generating your own electricity that doesn't come from the grid, and it doesn't impact anybody, except, perhaps, the environment. That's certainly something to consider. And lots of new data centers being built are running off of behind-the-meter natural gas with plans to replace these sources later. So behind-the-meter could be anything, from on-site gas turbines to fuel cells. And this report by Goldman says that behind the meter systems are expected to provide a quarter to a third of the incremental electricity demand from data centers that's anticipated through 2030, the chart we looked at earlier. That's a pretty significant amount. When we look at Colossus, so this is the massive data center that X AI built. Musk driving this. They told him it would take 730 days. They built this data center in 122 days. That's simply remarkable. When we look at where Musk's turbines come from, there's a company called Solaris trading under the ticker SEI. And they have a past that isn't so bright. So they were valued at around $1.65 billion and they suffered five straight quarters of falling revenues in their legacy oil field services. That's before they pivoted and acquired a company called Mobile Energy Rentals, and they rebranded this as Solaris Power Solutions, shifting their focus to gas-powered turbine leasing for data centers. All right. When you start to break down Solaris, you see that 96% of last year's revenue for that energy generation unit came from leasing revenue from xAI. So, I mean, do you really want to be sitting across the table from Musk having negotiations? No. You're not in a very good position. He's going to be able to strongarm you all over the place, and he certainly will. And Bloomberg correctly titles this article, Solaris ties its future to xAI's success in the AI boom. refers to this 7-year agreement that they have, though Musk could connect to the grid sooner than that. Presumably, he will. And what happens to this company that's hedged their entire success right now in xAI? xAI is leasing, and when you do that, you really don't have to worry a lot about risk. So, we don't know what the terms of those leases look like, but when you look on the back end, Solaris is sourcing these units from either purchasing them, subleasing them, or even refurbishments. So this really isn't an ideal solution. It seems to be what Musk could cobble together quickest to get that data center up and running. So it doesn't bode well necessarily for Solaris. And if Musk plugs into the grid and gets his solar farms online, then it really makes these turbines obsolete. Maybe they move to the next Colossus data center that's being built and they're just a temporary solution whilst Musk works as fast as he can to deploy data centers. For anybody that finds that story compelling enough to invest in, Hindenburg linked Morpheus targeted Solaris in their first short report. Here's how that works. If you're an investor in any company, you should be stoked when a firm issues a short report because they've gone out there and found every single red flag, every single reason not to invest in a company. They've done that for you. And then you can vet that and decide if you still want to make an investment. Don't be a Dgen and just pull an ostrich and put your head in the sand. You read the report. You see what takeaways are and you say, "Yeah, I think we'll stay invested." So, we see natural gas being used by data centers. And when you look at the Stargate AI data center being built by OpenAI, it's going to be the world's largest AI supercluster once it's fully built. And Sam Altman made the remark here. He said, "We're burning gas to run this data center again." And he says, "But the hope is to rely on many other power sources." Of course, we know Altman's connection with Oklo Nuclear coming down the road. We did a piece on that, looking at how it may not be the panacea to the AI energy woes, right? It's going to take a long time to build out, and some of these concepts are not proven at all. The SMR modular concepts, there's a lot of them out there, and for investors, you really need to watch that piece. If you think that nuclear energy is the way forward and be aware of the risks that are inherent to that thesis. So why not build out these small gas turbines and just use these extensively across all data centers? The fuel is cheap, right? These modular systems must be cheaper. Well, they're not really. So they actually have a much higher cost than that of the large combined-cycle natural gas turbines. But here's an interesting comment. Their modular nature makes them cost-competitive because what you can do is this. You have to have a 100% uptime, right? So if you have a 500 megawatt power plant and that goes down, you have to have another 500 megawatt power plant as a backup. Well, if you have five 100 megawatt turbines, these smaller installations, you only, perhaps, need to have two as backups because you're only ever going to have one go out at a time, or perhaps two. So they're saying here that actually makes them a lot more cost-competitive. And they go on to talk about how these solid oxide fuel cells, such as those produced by Bloom Energy, have higher upfront and maintenance costs but are far more fuel efficient, as we talked about, 10 to 30%. Of course, that advantage erodes as the price of natural gas falls. But the other advantage there is when you look at some of these lawsuits being leveled at Musk, that they're talking about environmental impact, and it's a lot easier, they say, for these fuel cell installations to get permits than it is for dirty gas turbines. Right? So investment angles, aside from Solaris that we talked about, which wouldn't be appealing from where we're sitting, for reasons that we gave, investing in spot natural gas commodity investment. You see this a lot. It's really speculative because it's quite cyclical, right? It's really a speculative thesis than it is saying, well, gas is going to go up perpetually because of the demand. No, it's not how it works, right? And for those of you that are looking for ETFs, you may come across this United States Natural Gas Fund under the ticker UNG. This is not a good investment. Probe around a little bit there. Says nothing to do with giving you exposure to the price of natural gas. It's about speculating on intra-day movements. You go look at the 10-year return is something like a loss of 99%. You can read the definitions as to how this vehicle works. Really, investing in spot natural gas is the least desirable way to get exposure to this thesis. You have natural gas producers and pipeline infrastructure. So, you then end up investing in a lot more than just the growth of data centers. This LNG thesis also comes into play. And you can read these pieces by Andreessen. They're rather verbose, but they sort of tie that in. The argument being that, well, LNG actually needs to pull back so that data centers can use all this natural gas instead of selling it. Then you have the manufacturers of turbines. So when it comes to the larger-scale units, the type of turbines being used by these large combined-gas cycle plants, we did a piece that looked at Caterpillar in that context. Commons. There's other firms out there building them. They talk about a seven-to-eight-year backlog. But they're also quite wary, in terms of ramping that up, because they know, and this comment here, from that earlier article, bulls may view this as an opportunity, but the restraint shown by larger manufacturers serves as a reminder to investors that heated markets do not always last. So, they're very wary of any sort of buildout. And then when you look at any company, be aware of the actual exposure you're getting. Again, going back to that piece we did on Caterpillar, looking at how you get very little exposure to that thesis by investing the stock. So, just some thoughts here. Seems like front-of-meter expansion, so these combined gas cycle plants, they're going to take a long time to ramp up because of the turbine backlog. Back-of-the-meter solutions can certainly provide some temporary capabilities while solar gets built out. That appears to be what Musk is doing, right? And then when nuclear energy comes online, later on down the road, right, it's very expensive. And when you look at how much it's moving the needle, it really is not very much. But eventually, we're going to start to gravitate again towards what's economical. Going back to that chart that Lazard has, which shows the most efficient forms of energy generation, always beware of booms that are temporary, right? As long-term investors, we want a thesis that extends beyond just half a decade. Now, Bloom Energy, a few premium subscribers have asked us about that. So, we're going to be covering their fuel cell deployments in a coming piece. We've certainly covered that firm for a very long time. Haven't looked at them for a while. So, we'll definitely take a look at that next. And if you're interested in reading more about what the state of nuclear energy is all about, we did this recent piece, quite popular, which looks at just that. Give that a watch next. Thanks so much for taking the time to watch this video today.
