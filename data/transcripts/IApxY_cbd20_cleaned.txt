You know how to tell someone's a Soundhound investor? They'll tell you. And it's SoundHound AI. Don't forget the AI part. Today's video isn't just about SoundHound AI. It's chalkfull of lessons on how to navigate the volatile world of AI stons. And make sure you watch the entire thing because I'm also going to share some very difficult news I received this week. So, the last time we looked at SoundHound AI, we said they were going to have a spectacular crash. So, did they? Well, kind of. Depends on when you looked at the chart. So, I don't like this "aged well" comments because, first of all, we can never really tell what the person's saying, whether they mean that or they're being sarcastic. 90% of the time they're being sarcastic. But this chart shows the price action for SoundHound AI since the last time we covered it, which was roughly a year ago. So, if you watched that piece, I don't know, a couple weeks after it was published, you'd put, "Well, this aged well because the price of the stock had gone up significantly." But then, if you waited a while, indeed, there was a spectacular crash. So you could say this aged well. And then of course it got pumped up again. So you could say this aged well. And then it went back down and you could say this aged well again. So yes, it did age well. But what's more important to look at is the price performance since this company had their SPAC debut. And you can see here that anyone who bought shares of SoundHound AI when they had their SPAC would have underperformed the NASDAQ, which isn't necessarily a bad thing because that means that while we didn't miss very much, and if you invested now, then you'd presumably be investing at a reasonable valuation. However, since most SPACs were overvalued, that doesn't necessarily add up. And we'll look at valuation in a second. But when we go back and look at their SPAC deck, we can see these aggressive targets they put down that never happened. That calls into question the company's ability to execute. But let's put that aside and look at what growth they've been able to achieve thus far. Now, this was taken from our last presentation. All we've done here is plotted their revenues out over time, and then we extrapolated their guidance by quarter. So, we're going to go ahead and break out these four quarters for 2025 and see what they actually did. And here we've done that. So, red is the estimates that we had. Green is their actuals, and that black bar there, that reflects this next quarter, what they're guiding towards. So, it seems like they're tracking quite well to guidance. We'll talk about the revenue growth in a second. But what's on exhibit here is really a typical SPAC playbook. You raise a bunch of money by making grandiose promises. Then you realize that you'll never even come close to hitting those growth targets. So you take your cash windfall and start buying companies to bolt on some growth. Now, one problem with that is most acquisitions don't achieve synergies. And when you look at the hyped AI space right now, what sort of bargains are you going to hope to get by purchasing AI companies right now? Probably not very good ones, right?Yyou're probably going to pay a rich premium for whatever revenue you're acquiring. And of course, you can point to this strong revenue growth they're experiencing as some proof of greatness. But that just means that future growth is going to require more acquisitions. And of course, they can issue shares until the end of time to fund more acquisitions as long as they have the price support. And this appears to be exactly what they're doing. Rarely does this strategy work out as planned. So, a number of consultancies have examined how M&A works over time, and most M&A deals don't realize the synergies that are expected. And here you can see the last time that we were able to plot out SoundHound's organic revenue growth, which wasn't all that. And you can see they've made a number of notable acquisitions and continue to make acquisitions. The question here is, will the synergies between these acquired companies and the products they have in-house generate revenue synergies through cross-selling and such? Well, that remains to be seen, but you need to ask the question of whether or not they're acquiring quality. And when you look at the company's gross margins over time, you see here they've gone from upwards of 70% down to 40%. That's rather misleading because if we consider amortization their gross margins are somewhere around 60% which really isn't that bad. And you can go into the earnings press release and look at the non-GAAP numbers, you see here amortization of intangibles which relates to the acquisitions they made is distorting gross margin. So this is a fair use of showing something in non-GAAP so investors can better understand that metric. Now when you look at one of their competitors, Cerrence for example, they have much stronger gross margins, GAAP gross margins, you see here around 80%. And what's more impressive, perhaps, is that they have positive free cash flow. And that's something that when you look at SoundHound's investor deck and the sort of language coming from the management team that I've seen, there's nothing relating to a sense of urgency around getting to cash flow positive. And of course, when it comes to disruptive growth companies, that isn't a priority necessarily, but there needs to be some visibility into that. And we'd much rather opt for companies that have that in mind because whilst capital is very easy to raise right now, that may not be the case around the corner. Now, when we look at their revenues, I pulled up this table of revenues by geography and it's all rather interesting. So, Japan has disappeared for some reason. And you can see here 2025E represents an extrapolation of the first 9 months of 2025. So I don't understand what the expansion is in the other category. Korea seems to be dropping off there. There's speculation that's actually Hyundai and that may have been the customer concentration risk they had before. Then you see China emerging on the scene. That's a bit of a concern because the Chinese are doing very well when it comes to voice recognition, facial recognition, things like that. They've been doing a lot of work in that space, and listening to Mandarin speakers is a lot different from listening to English speakers. So that's something that certainly raised some eyebrows. So when you look at revenue growth, they were officially guiding to 165 million in 2025. That's a growth of 95%. Again, we don't know how much of that is organic versus all the acquisitions they've been making. But now they're guiding to 172.5 million. So growth of 104%. This question is key. What would revenue growth be like without all these acquisitions? And that question is now very tough to answer as they've merged their financials. If they stop acquiring companies, doesn't seem like they will. Then what does their growth look like? More importantly, what sort of competition is there in this space right now? Is this going to become a commodity offering? And I think everything leads us to believe that it will. But before we get into that, there's something really difficult that I have to tell you. I received some very unfortunate news yesterday. I never thought I'd have to say this, but our Romanian fortune teller submitted her resignation letter via carrier pigeon, of course, so it took a while to get here. So, to make up for her extended leave of absence, she's offering all paying subscribers 12 basis points of Alpha each month until the end of the year. So, a Nanalyze premium subscription not only pays for itself, and it already did before, but now it actually makes you more wealthy, and better looking. Plus, we're actively searching for her replacement. So, that means more alpha is coming down the road. When life hands us lemons, we make lemonade. And speaking of lemons, let's get back to talking about SoundHound. So, I like this piece here by Sierra Ventures. It's a market map of the over-150 AI voice companies out there. And if SoundHound, being the pioneer that they are, had this all wrapped up, perhaps there wouldn't be so much funding being poured into AI voice, and presumably, although that's probably not a guarantee these days with all the hype, many of these, if not most of these AI startups are showing strong growth. In other words, they're capturing market share that SoundHound AI isn't. And perhaps the leader on that list would be Eleven Labs, and they recently had this $100 million tender where they offer to buy shares back from existing investors and they're doing so at a valuation of $6.6 billion. And in this press release, they talk about how earlier this year they surpassed a $200 million annual run rate. Again, that's probably revenue that SoundHound should have been grabbing, but perhaps it's just because these companies are targeting different niches. And they're expected to grow that ARR to around 300 million by the end of this year. So, let's take the most inflated valuation for Eleven Labs and the midpoint of that ARR number, so $250 million, and let's calculate our simple valuation ratio, which is just market cap divided by annualized revenues, we get 26. Well, now we have a valuation benchmark that we can use for Soundhound. And when we plot SoundHound's simple valuation ratio over time, you can see that number here. So the blue line represents the last four-quarter average. And we always tell investors to have some sort of valuation metric that you can use and then set yourself a cut-off so you don't get burned by hype. So 30 would be that cut-off if you took the last four-quarter average. Now, for us, we don't invest in anything three times our catalog average, which sits, let's say, somewhere around 7.5. So, let's say that's in the low 20s. So, I've marked that here with the red line. And when you look at our catalog average, it becomes clear that SoundHound is objectively overvalued. Now, you could argue that's because of all their growth, but again, when we go back and look at what type of growth that is, it's growth by acquisition. And when you see this big spike they have in valuation, that was probably around the time that everybody was raving about NVIDIA's investment in SoundHound AI. And this was a slide taken from that last piece, we said NVIDIA's investment is entirely meaningless, which is why it sits there doing nothing. That was based on the size of their investment and how much equity it represented in the company, which probably since then, has been significantly diluted. But that NVIDIA thesis evaporated when NVIDIA exited. So this is their latest holdings. And just remember, what you see NVIDIA holding in their 13-F, it doesn't mean what you think it does. And SoundHound is just another example of that. Now speaking of dilution, it seems like dilution over at SoundHound is going to continue until morale improves. And you can see here share count has more than doubled since their SPAC debut. So, if you invested at $10 a share and share count doubles, then your shares are now worth $5 a share, all things being equal. And one of the reasons share count is increasing so much is that SoundHound has an at-the-market offering. So, they just sell shares into this hype, take the cash, and then put it on their balance sheet and use that for acquisitions and for continuing to burn through all the cash that the company is consuming. You can see here operating cash flows over the past trailing 12 months about $100 million. So they have an end cash position of $268 million. You get about 2 and a half years left. That's pretty suitable. So when we look at the conclusions of our last video, we said their very aggressive revenue targets should be watched closely. Well, they're doing quite good there despite the fact that this is all bolt-on revenue growth. And even if we look at their valuation using their 2025 target, it's rather rich at an SVR of 27, though that's right around where Eleven Labs is, though Eleven Labs seems to be a much more superior business in terms of quality. We said to watch gross margins and especially operating margins for synergy. So, if they're going to realize all these benefits from the companies that they're acquiring, then we want to see operating margins start to tighten up. Obviously, they're ridiculously negative right now, but we want to see a trajectory that's moving in the right direction there. One could argue that the acquired companies may be masking a stagnation of organic revenues. Makes you wonder what all that R&D money that they're spending is going towards. And it's going to be increasingly tough to decipher true growth with this flurry of M&A activities. SoundHound AI isn't a buy for us. It's a bye. And we're not short. We never short. It's bad idea. It's just that there are a lot better companies to look at out there that aren't targeting a commodity offering that have much better valuations and much better growth opportunities in front of them. Now, I know that a lot of folks out there who treat investing like a pissing contest are going to be rather upset by some of the things that we said today, but just remember that when someone casts a critical eye at your sacred cow, that's really a good thing. And the pervasiveness of cheerleaders around this stock, that's really a red flag. I don't know why it is that whenever you have a company that has an at-the-market offering, there's always cheerleaders around. Odd. There's things to like, of course, about SoundHound, mainly their revenue growth, which, while strong, is the result of M&A, and that's not what the SPAC deck promised. Don't forget that. Now, this is going to age well in both directions. But regardless, this isn't a company we would invest in. And if you want exposure to voice AI, ask yourself why. This is a commodity offering that's likely going to be consumed by LLMs eventually. If anything, Eleven Labs looks like a much more exciting way to play this. And whatever you do, don't try to stockpick your way to wealth. That's actually a topic we covered in a recent video that you ought to give a watch next. Thanks so much for taking the time to watch this video today.
