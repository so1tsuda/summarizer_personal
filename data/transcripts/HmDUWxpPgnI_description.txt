100 AI leaders across product, engineering, research, and design gathered at StratMinds’ Swell Summit to answer one question: What will actually win in the next era of AI products?
From new interaction models to experience-first design, this reveals what thoughtful builders are paying attention to and what many teams are still missing.
There's one particular idea they kept returning to throughout the summit, a critical insight that most of us rarely pause to consider deeply. Watch to discover what it is.

Key Takeaways:
📌 We need to go beyond basic chat and embrace new interaction primitives like semantic resizing, remixing, and format translation that redefine how people engage with AI.
📌 Products that feel alive, emotional, and responsive create deeper user connection.
📌 As models become commodities, intuitive AI ergonomics becomes the true differentiator.
📌 Start with what the model can uniquely do to uncover solutions users haven’t imagined.
📌 Real progress comes from solving the right problems, not just shipping fast.
