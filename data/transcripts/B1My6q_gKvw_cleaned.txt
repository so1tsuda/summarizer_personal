So, always make sure to do your own work and consult with a professional before making any investment decision. With that being said, the topic of today's podcast is going to be the company iRoot. So, most of you are probably familiar with iRoot products, but just a brief history of the company itself. , they're they created the category of mainstream residential robot vacuum cleaners. They came out with the first Roomba vacuum cleaner in 2002. , they went public a few years later around 2005. And throughout the the rest of the 2000s and especially the early part of the 2010s, they grew strongly. You know, they had almost 100% market share and their revenue grew from about $125 million a year in 2005 to almost 10 times that in 2019 and they were profitable. However, starting especially in the mid2010s, a lot of competition in this industry started coming up, especially from various Chinese companies. So, a lot of these Chinese companies came out with similar products that were cheaper but were also superior in most ways. So, they had better floor mapping. They were less liable to get stuck in corners and things of that nature. had stronger suction and more other convenient modern features. , it came to the point where today if you go on Google and you look up a list of the top robot vacuum cleaners on the market today, iRoot products are almost never at the top of any of those lists. So, if you look at this example, the best quality vacuum cleaner, best mid-range, and best budget vacuum cleaner, robot vacuum cleaners, , none of these none of these topof-the- list products are iRoot. And in fact, , three of these four are Chinese products. The only one that's not a Chinese product is the best budget robot vacuum cleaner. So by because of these factors, you know, the Chinese competition especially being cheaper and higher quality than iRoot, , by today, iRoot's market share has fallen to only about 10 to 15%. in 2022 because of and in part because of these the business deteriorating for iRoot so direly their only lifeline was a bid by Amazon to acquire iRoot in 2022. so Amazon was going to buy buy iRoot for about $1.4 billion. However, regulators, especially the European Commission, heavily opposed the deal because a very large portion of the robot vacuum cleaners that get sold on the market on the market today are sold through Amazon.com. And so the regulators fear was that Amazon may give pre preferential treatment to iRoot listings at the expense of its competitors. And so over a period of time, Amazon decided that there is there's no viable way to get past these regulatory concerns. And so they terminated the deal in 2000 in 2024. After the after that acquisition was terminated, iRoot had really no solution to its business problems and the stock declined more than 25% more than 95% from its lows. Its revenue tanked by over 50% from its peak. , today it's now losing hundreds of millions of dollars per year. , and it's left with only, you know, as of the latest quarterly report, it only has about $25 million of cash equivalents. On top of that, it also has a $200 million loan with no foreseeable way to repay it. So, obviously, very, very dire financial situation with very little prospect of improvement given that just has an inferior product. Despite this situation that iRoot finds itself in in terms of business and financial position in the past month, it has had iRoot stock has had an inexplicable surge. It's gone up more than it's more than doubled in stock price over just the past month. And for no real fundamental reason that can be easily explained. So for that to get into more of that, I'll hand it over to you James to talk about some of the details. So, as Ryan said, iRoot's financial condition is dire. And we're going to now dig down into the details to see just how dire the financial situation is and why we believe iRoot is on the brink of bankruptcy and could indeed declare bankruptcy within the coming weeks. So, also as Ryan said, iRoot has a $200 million loan $191 million loan to be precise that comes if this loan matures I believe in J in July of 2026. However, we believe that this loan is already in technical default. While the loan does not mature until July of 2026, it does have a covenant. And that covenant states that the loan is considered to be in default if iRoot's auditor gives them a going concern notice. And if they are in technical default, then the lender has the right to demand early repayment. iRoot has had a going concern notice I think since like six months ago. They've always they've their auditor has given them a going concern notice given their disastrous financial situation. Now, when they first got the going concern notice earlier this year, the lender gave them a waiver saying, "Oh, you have a few months to resolve the going concern notice, , and you know, we've waved the terms of the covenant until then." And they would keep getting these extensions to the covenant. Now, the most recent extension ended on December 1st, 2025. Now we are past we're now as of the time of recording this video it's it is December 12th. So that last extension we've already surpassed it and iRoot still almost certainly has a going concern notice because their financial position is still very bad. So now I believe [clears throat] I believe that iRoot is indeed in technical default of the loan. Now the loan was originally the money was originally lent by a consortium of creditors including the Carlilele group in on November 24th 2025. The original creditors Carlilele and TCG they sold this loan to a company called Santrum Hong Kong company. Now Santrum is iRoot's contract manufacturer. So, iRoot, they designed the Roomba robot and they own the intellectual property and the Roomba brand and everything, but they don't actually manufacture it. They pay this Chinese company, Santrum, to manufacture it on their behalf. Now, why would Santrum want to purchase iRoot's debt? And in addition to now owning this loan that iRoot now owes them, iRoot owes $162 million to Santrum as payment for their contract manufacturing services of which $91 million is passed due. So iRoot has already defaulted on $91 million of payments that they have to make to Santrum just for the contract manufacturing. So, iRoot is already in default to Santrum. In addition to that, Santrum now also purchased this $192 million loan. So, iRoot owes them the past due payments plus this massive loan. So, given that iRoot was already in default to Santrum, why would Santrum purchase the loan so that iRoot owes them even more money? Well, the only rationale I can think of is that Santrum believes iRoot is about to go bankrupt. If they now that they've purchased the loan, Santrum is iRoot's largest creditor by far. Being the largest creditor, once iRoot goes bankrupt, Santrum will be able to, you know, take control of the company and take control of all of its assets after the bankruptcy process. and Sandrum, they already manufacture the Roombas. If iRoot goes bankrupt, they're the creditor. They can take all of iRoot's assets during the bankruptcy process. That means they will be able to get access to the Roomba brand and all of iRoot's intellectual property, at which point they will be able to continue manufacturing the Roomba vacuum cleaners and sell it on their own because they will then own the brand. So the only rationale, the only reason I think that Santrum is doing this is because they know iRoot is about to go bankrupt and they're going to take the brand and all the intellectual property during the bankruptcy process and the default is probably imminent. So, as of the end of iRoot's third quarter, which was September 27th, 2025, iRoot had only $25 million of cash. I don't think they've raised they have not raised any capital since then. And they've pro of that $25 million they had at September 27th, they've probably burned through almost all of it by now. That's why they have already defaulted on the $90 million that they owe to Santrum because they just don't have the money to pay it. So now in total, if you add up the loan plus the payments for the contract manufacturing services, iRoot owes Santrum $352 million, of which $282 million is already in default. That's the loan plus the $91 million of payments that are passed due. Realistically, there is no way for iRoot to make good on these liabilities. The share price has had an inexplicable surge over the past few weeks. But even after this surge in share price, iRoot's market cap is only $160 million. They owe $352 million to Sandra. even if they were to issue a bunch of new shares, the you know, even if they were to try to double their share count by issuing new shares and raising capital, even doubling their share count, that would only raise them $160 million and that would actually tank the stock price. So, they would actually raise way less than that. There's really no way that a 160 million market cap company would be able to sell enough shares to pay their $352 million worth of liabilities that they owe to Sandra. So bankruptcy seems like at this point bankruptcy seems unavoidable. Now, why did the stock price increase so much? , you know, why did I robot stock price increase so much over the past few weeks? Well, the only explanation is that iRoot has become a meme stock. iRoot stock is heavily shorted because, you know, people have seen for the past year at least that this company is a disaster. After the Amazon deal was terminated, a lot of people could see that iRoot's business was unviable and the company will likely eventually go bankrupt. So, a lot of short sellers came in and started shorting the stock. This created a very high short interest and the share price declined, you know, to around $1 as of late November. So, a lot of the meme traders like the saw, oh, this is a stock, a small market cap stock with very high short interest. Maybe we should all buy shares and try to cause a short squeeze. And that's basically what happened. There was a short squeeze and all of these meme traders were bidding up the price of the stock and that explains the increase. However, the market cap of the company is still too small. So, that's not going to save them from bankruptcy. The iRoot is still probably going to go bankrupt within the next few weeks or months at most. Once the once the company goes bankrupt, it will be delisted from the NASDAQ and it will have to go to trading on the over-the-counter markets, at which point the share price is almost guaranteed to collapse because most of these meme traders are trading on Robin Hood or other similar stock brokerages that do not support trading on over-the-counter markets. So once it's OTC, these meme traders probably won't even be able to buy shares anymore and the price will collapse. So iRoot is a failed company. This meme rally is just a ridiculous thing and the stock is still probably going to go to zero over the next few weeks after the company goes bankrupt. So that's about all we had to talk about iRoot today. As always, if you have any opinions or thoughts about iRoot, please let us know in the comments section below. And we will see you all on next week's video.
