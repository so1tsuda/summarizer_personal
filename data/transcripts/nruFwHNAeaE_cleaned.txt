The older you get, the more you care about investing in safe stocks. What do I mean by safe? In the words of Mr. Buffett himself, these are stocks that you'd be comfortable holding if the stock market closed for the next 10 years. Today's stock we don't ever plan to sell, and we likely will never have to because it's probably one of the safest biotechs out there. You want to know which one it is, don't you? You and your 7-second attention span. Well, if you click the like button on this video, the name of the stock is going to pop up. Go ahead, click it. There you go. It's Abbott Labs. And today, we're going to talk about three things. Why Abbott is so safe and what "safe" means. Abbott's position is the highest-ranked core dividend growth stock in our Quantigence universe. And the biggest issue we have with a company, you always should be the most critical of firms that you're most bullish about. So I remember getting asked this question in B school numerous times. The instructor would say what's the highest priority for any business, and everybody would say profits or growth or returning money to shareholders. Well, the answer is simply this. The number one goal of any business is simply to survive. Now DGens who don't know this are simply helping along plenty of [ __ ] companies that shouldn't be surviving as long as they have. SPACs are a great example of this, and I think the jury is still out on some of those names. Just remember that a business without revenues is not a business. It's just an entity in survival mode, scrambling to raise capital. So how does a business not survive? Well, it can go bankrupt, and usually that's a debt problem. Some black swan event can befall the company and it can go into bankruptcy. Though debt is the vast majority of the reasons why companies go bankrupt. Or it can also dwindle into a former shadow of itself and be acquired by another company. Basically, it runs out of options for capital. Now, I asked ChatGPT to tell me about the industries that have the most bankruptcies as a proportion of the number of companies in the industry. And I think the answers here are pretty obvious. You have retail, hospitality, construction. Basically, the industries you see here listed, they won't have many or in some cases any dividend champions. And there are a number of reasons for that. I think you'd have to go into each industry to examine that. But maybe a better question to ask would be what industries have the least number of bankruptcies as a proportion of the total numbers in each industry? That would be because they either have stable demand or are less sensitive to economic downturns, or both. And look what bubbles to the top of the list. It's health care. And we've always said that if we had to pick one industry to invest in, we would always choose health care because it's not going away. People will always have money. Well, in some cases they won't, but if they do have money, they'll spend it on their health as a priority. Now, one belief that I used to hold was that conglomerates were, and perhaps they are, a great way to invest in a single company, if you could only invest in one company, because they enjoy internal diversification. And there's an interesting statement you'll see thrown around. We always talk about how there's no such thing as a free lunch. And there is one exception to that, they say, which is diversification because it allows you to reduce portfolio risk and increase potential returns without taking on additional risk. And you can read more into that philosophical statement. But in the equities space, diversification across geography and industry and of course things like your customer base, right? But broadly speaking, geography and industry are critically important. So if you must pick one stock, you'd want to see internal diversification. And of course, conglomerates have that, right? They're usually a collection of businesses across multiple industries. However, there's some problems there. Not the least being that you possibly won't have a lot of synergies between businesses that operate in different industries. But some of the causes of the conglomerate discount, that is that conglomerates trade historically at a discount to what they should. And trying to explain why that is, I think ChatGPT does a good job of summarizing it. A conglomerate's management team probably lacks experience in all the diverse fields it operates in. And consequently, since you have too many chefs in the kitchen, you'll have challenges in terms of allocating capital and resources across these various businesses. And many investors would argue, well, why not just create your own collection of diversified companies that are each pure play in various industries and have your own conglomerate exposure without the conglomerate discount. And that's a fair statement. And of course, I think this holds true for any company. If you have several lower-performing divisions, this can impact the overall market value of the company. Now, when we look at the health care sector, we break it down by what's called the Global Industry Classification Standard or GICs. You can see here there are quite a lot of categories. And if you were a health care company that was diversified across these different classifications, that would be a great form of internal diversification. And, indeed, we see that with Abbott. This was taken from their 2024 investor report. And at the top here you can see Diversity by Technology. I think Nutrition there perhaps might fall under consumer staples. But then you have these other areas,: Medicines, Medical Devices, and Diagnostics. When it comes to geography, some great diversification, right? And I like their exposure to emerging markets and the fact that they call that out. That's where all the population growth is going to come from in the future, it seems. And they also talk about Diversity by Payer, which is important in the healthcare industry. And when you dig into that report, you're going to find this granular table which describes each of these segments and subsegments. It's about the richest set of metrics you're going to find for Abbott. Unfortunately, they don't provide a lot of investor relations collateral. That's something we're going to talk about later. But the big news for Abbott recently is that they're acquiring Exact Sciences. And when you look at their four key business units, you see Medical Devices dominating. This was from last quarter. The revenues from each segment. Diagnostics, that's going to go up significantly. So revenues from Exact Sciences, that's the company they want to purchase, were around $850 million last quarter. So tack that on to the Diagnostics segment. It's good to see that these are becoming more evenly balanced out. And as a result of acquiring Exact Sciences, Abbott's going to be taking on some debt. And before we talk about that, I wanted to touch on debt and survivability. So bankruptcy, by definition, is an inability to pay back debts, right? And the majority of bankruptcies relate to this. Without debt, typically bankruptcies wouldn't occur. And that's because companies can always take on more debt to survive. As long as a company can keep raising capital, they can survive perpetually, right? But when they can't service their debt or nobody's willing to extend them more debt or buy their shares, then the company's toast. And we can look at real-world confirmation from major studies that show just that. Debt is responsible for the vast majority of bankruptcies. So we want to pay very close attention to debt for any company we want to consider safe. And you always want to focus on net debt. So take the long-term debt on their balance sheet and subtract from that their cash. You get net debt. Abbott has net debt of $3.6 billion. That's not a whole lot for a $200 billion company, intuitively. And when you go into that 2024 report, they break down their debt and lines of credit. You can look at this year versus the last year. You can see when they mature. So this is important. That's when the money that they owe others comes due, right? And they have a nice spread of varying durations over time. These fixed interest rates look okay. And to fund this Exact Sciences deal, they're going to take out a $20 billion bridge loan. So, they're really going to increase their debt. And they plan to eventually refinance that. I think the bridge loan comes due within a year, they'll need to raise more debt to replace that with bonds or other instruments. So, we'll see how that goes. When it comes to rating a company's debt, especially large firms that are covered by major credit ratings agencies, you want to pay attention to those reports. They're super valuable. You can often find them for free and they describe any potential problems a company might run into. I've circled here on this spectrum of classifications where Abbott sits for S&P and Moody's. So, they're investment grade. They're just below the highest tier of investment-grade debt. So, that would be a good thing to do, right? Look at the companies you're holding and see how many are in the speculative grade area. But that may change at least for S&P, which has placed Abbott on credit watch, they say, with negative implications following their planned acquisition of Exact Sciences. So you want to pay attention to that. When we look at the deal structure, they're going to raise $20 billion from that bridge loan. They're assuming $1.8 billion in debt from Exact Sciences. So, what, they're going to increase their debt around $22 billion. The transaction is expected to close the middle of next year. And the strategic rationale, well, they have an investor deck they put out, surprisingly, that goes over that. It's quite good. Give it a glance if you're an Abbott shareholder. And they project this $50 million in annual synergies by year three. And when you look at the data, it shows that, I think, only a third of time companies realize synergies. So you're really looking for larger firms that have experience in acquiring other companies and they're able to create those synergies. Let's hope that's Abbott. And since this is a value stock, we hold this as part of our dividend growth investment strategy. We're not so interested in the revenue side of things. We're more interested in earnings or, specifically, cash flows. So you can see here along the top the net earnings from Abbott for the past 3 years, but I've highlighted the cash from operating activities. So, as the old saying goes: earnings are an opinion, cash is a fact. And we want to make sure that they're generating a nice healthy chunk of cash they can use to service that debt. Now, when you look here at where the cash being thrown off from their business goes, you can see, well, they're making some investments with that - acquisitions of property and equipment - but also under Financing activities, they're purchasing back stock and also paying dividends. So, if you take dividends and express them as a percentage of operating cash flows, which that's typically not how payout ratio is calculated. They base it off earnings. But I always like to look at operating cash flows against dividends paid. Or more accurately, free cash flow which shows what they have after capex. But here you can see their operating cash flows easily would cover that dividend. They also have some leeway if they stopped buying back their shares. So it seems like the interest on this debt they would be easily able to cover. And since we've invested in Abbott as part of our dividend growth investing strategy, dividend growth is a critical component. It's one of the reasons why this is the highest-ranked stock in our Quantigence core universe. It's because across the board they have great metrics, such as their low payout ratio, their 10-year growth rate which approaches 10%. So every year, essentially, you've been getting a 10% raise in that dividend income. That's great. That adds up really fast over time. And when we look at the entire Q-score here, we've calculated that using a number of factors including size, the number of years they've increased the dividend, international sales, 5-year, 10-year dividend growth, and their yield, which is rather low. But again, just pay attention to the growth because that yield, what they call the yield on cost, changes very quickly when you have a dividend growing at double digits. However, the Q-scores that you see here don't change very often, which is one of the things that makes this strategy quite unique. And we update these actually twice a year and provide commentary on the changes. Very informative. So, now that Abbott is acquiring Exact Sciences, we're rather excited about that because that happens to be a disruptive tech stock we like. We've covered it extensively over the years. And we're quite stoked now that, potentially, they'll be acquired by Abbott and we can actually hold that stock as part of our Abbott holding. And when you look at this slide from Abbott, it talks about this delicate balance they have between returning cash to shareholders whilst investing appropriately so that they can keep growing their business, whether that's top-line revenues or the bottom-line earnings per share. And they seem to be doing that balancing act quite well. You can dig further. I think they had an investor relations deck earlier this year that talks a little bit more about that. But that leads me to the biggest point of contention that I have with this firm. They don't have - unless I couldn't find them, they should be very easy to find - investor decks that accompany earnings calls so that you can quickly scan through. And of course, we only check in with companies once a year. We find that cadence allows you to sort of remove the noise and really be able to understand how a company's progressing. But they also don't have any high-level investment deck, aside from that one I mentioned back in January of last year, which certainly isn't updated as it needs to be. But, since we've invested in this company as part of that dividend growth strategy, we sort of set it and forget it. We don't check in very often with our dividend growth holdings because they sort of just sit there and appreciate in value and our income every year goes up and we're certainly happy with that. You get the income growth component and the capital appreciation which you don't even touch. And if you snowball that dividend growth, then it really starts to get impactful and that's what we looked at in our research paper on the performance from this strategy. And we did a piece on that, which talked about how it absolutely spanked the S&P 500. So, we're glad now to be holding this stock and I think the next time that we would check in with them would be once that Exact Sciences acquisition goes through and give that some time for dust to settle. In the meantime, if you're interested in investing on the disruptive growth side, there's an AI healthcare stock that we invested in this year that I think is rather interesting. Give that video a watch next. Thanks so much for taking the time to watch this today.
