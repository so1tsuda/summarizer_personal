Hello and welcome back to the Broken Business Models podcast. We are your hosts, Ryan and James. And before we get into today's podcast, just a quick disclaimer, nothing in this podcast or any of our other material should be taken as investment advice. James and I could have positions in any of the stocks we may mention today and we reserve the right to change those positions at any time. So, always make sure you do your own work and consult with a professional before making any investment decision. With that being said, the topic of today's podcast is going to be Plug Power. So to start off, just a quick refresher, Plug Power is a company who is in the business in the business of hydrogen fuel cells. So they create these hydrogen fuel cell devices, which are basically these little electronic devices that take in hydrogen gas, so H2 gas, and then produce as output electricity. So it is a electricity storage solution similar to a rechargeable battery where instead of just storing the electricity in the chemicals of the battery you store the energy in the form of hydrogen gas and then when you need the electricity you run the hydrogen gas through the fuel cell and it produces the electricity. The problem is that in terms of the cost of producing the hydrogen required to generate one unit of electricity, it is much more expensive than a regular rechargeable battery and thus is not economically viable on any scale except for very niche use cases. And so Plug Power sells these hydrogen fuel cell devices to customers. But they also have to sell the hydrogen fuel itself at a massive discount, significantly below its own cost to produce the hydrogen in order for it to make sense for any of their customers to actually use these hydrogen fuel cell devices. Otherwise, they would just use a much cheaper solution like a rechargeable battery. So they sell the hydrogen fuel cell devices. They also sell the hydrogen fuel at below cost. And they also make a little bit of revenue from selling from the electricity generated by some of their hydrogen fuel cells. as I mentioned just now the entire system is not economically viable and so plug power basically subsidizes the entire system and because of that they make massive gross losses on all the revenue that they generate. Their financials are nothing short of disastrous. So as you can see here in this chart I have the quarterly revenue and operating income of the company going back a couple of years in almost all quarters they burn something something around 200 to $300 million in operating losses which is on the same order of magnitude as the amount of revenue that they generate. So they're losing about as much money in operating losses as they make in revenue. Over time, these losses have piled up and in early 2025, they had to come to terms with it in some in some capacity and so they initiated something called Project Quantum Leap, which the name Project Quantum Leap sounds like something really exciting and really, you know, really exciting for the future, but in reality, it was just a massive effort to cut costs and reduce their massive losses that they're generating. So massive layoffs, facilities consolidation, other types of cost cuts, and also they said they were going to start increasing the pricing of their hydrogen fuel that they sell to customers. if you remember, I mentioned that they sell hydrogen fuel to their fuel cell customers at below cost. So they said they're going to try to increase the pricing of this hydrogen fuel in order to recoup some of those losses. Despite that, their gross losses and their cost of goods sold have continued to be extremely bad. In the re in the most recent quarter, their cost of revenue and gross loss both actually increased by $20 million versus the year ago period, despite the fact that they actually generated a little bit less revenue than the year ago period. In terms of their financial position, at the end of the most recent quarter, they only had about $166 million of cash in cash equivalents, which is less than one quarter's worth of cash burn. They also had to raise about $400 million in just a few days ago in November of 2025 in the form of convertible notes. but even after that cash raise, they still have less than one year worth of cash. So they're going to have to reduce costs further increase revenue or raise additional capital in order to avoid bankruptcy. So one last thing to mention about Plug Power's background is earlier this month the stock briefly pumped had a increase in share price due to something that happened that is related to the current data center and AI narrative. So they announced a non-binding letter of intent with a data center company that is currently building out data centers across the country. And what's going to happen is that current that plug power previously had been planning to planning a green hydrogen production facility in New York for which they had electricity purchase agreements with electricity companies to power this green hydrogen production facility. this agreement with the data center company is for Plug Power to essentially cancel their plans to build this green hydrogen production facility and divert those electricity purchase contracts to the data center companies to instead use the electricity for their data centers. , so this could potentially generate over $275 million for plug power, but it is probably not going to amount to anything because it's a non-binding letter of intent and so most likely it's not going to move the needle in either direction. But something to mention because it did affect the stock price briefly. So with that being said, I'll kick it over to you James to talk more about the specifics of Plug Power's current situation.

>> Yeah. So, first Ryan mentioned the project quantum leap where Plug Power in 2025 was trying to reduce costs and reduce the amount of money that they're losing. And if we look at this chart of their free cash flow each quarter, so their quarterly cash burn, 2025 does have a significant improvement over 2024, but they're still burning a lot of cash. So in just the first nine months of 2025, they burn Plug Power burned $500 million, but that's still a huge cash burn, but it's less cash than they burned in 2024. So part of that is indeed due to their cost cuts and layoffs and such. However, another thing we have to consider is that throughout this period, their inventory decreased a lot. So, they've been running down their inventory failing to produce new hydrogen inventory. And that's a way that they've tried to improve their cash firm situation. However, that's not a sustainable solution because if you're just trying to improve your improve your cash flow by reducing inventory, eventually you run out of inventory and there's some amount of inventory that you need to actually run the business. So, this is a temporary benefit of them running down the inventory. and despite them running down the inventory, they're still burning a huge amount of cash. So the core business is still is still unviable and is still losing a lot of money. so we need to we need to keep that in mind as we analyze the company further. So in the early part in the first half of 2025, that's when Plight Power was talking about their project quantum leap and they were saying, "Oh, we're going to cut all these costs, do all these layoffs, do all these other things, and that's supposedly going to get us to profitability." And one of the big, if you follow Plug Power over the previous years, they have always, Plug Power has incurred operating losses since inception. And they have typically funded their operating losses by selling new shares of by selling new stock onto the market. Basically, they use dilutive equity raises to raise capital to fund their cash burn. Now, in April of 2025, they announced a loan that they had secured a loan of up to $500 million. And they said, "Now that we got this loan, this is enough cash to get us through the rest of the year." And at the time in April of 2025, they said as a result of them securing this loan, Plug Power has no intention of raising additional equity in 2025, underscoring its focus on discipline capital management. So just in April, they said that we have enough money, we don't need to sell more stock in 2025. Well, then what happened in the third quarter of 2025? So just a few months after they made that statement, what do they do? They sell 29 million shares of stock to raise $76 million. So they're this project quantum leap, this cost cutting initiative that they had for 2025, it has failed to deliver the intended results. Plug Power is still losing an obscene amount of money and they are still obliged to do dilutive equity raises to raise capital just to keep the lights on. And this you should the fact that they said we don't need to sell stock and then a few months later they sell a ton of stock that just shows that whatever management says whatever whatever future projections and guidance that plug powers management gives cannot be trusted because they have such a horrible track record of keeping their promises. Now back in like 2020 2021 when there was this whole stock market bubble during COVID related to green energy and hydrogen and whatever poly power share price was very high and they were able to sell stock because their stock price was so high they were able to sell stock and generate huge proceeds from their equity issuance. So they had, you know, back in 2022, they had billions of dollars of cash on their balance sheet because they were able to raise so much money by selling their stock. But then their as they've they've quickly burned through their cash balance. And over the past couple years, their share price has been so low. It's usually been only like$1 or $2 per share. And when the share price is so low, they sell a lot of shares, but they are not even able to raise that much capital. So they're they've been basically only raising cash. They've basically only been able to raise capital as fast as they can burn it. So, their cash balance has remained pretty low over the past couple years, but they at least today they have still been able to raise enough cash each quarter to not to avoid bankruptcy, but they're really operating on the margin here where they're living hand-to-mouth and basically burning money almost as fast as they can raise it. thus resulting in a persistently low a persistently low cash balance which puts the company always in a precarious position. So now let's look at the details of their financial position. So as of the end of the third quarter on September 30th, 2025, Plug Power had 166 million of cash. They also had 1.2 billion common shares outstanding. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, so in October of 2025, they did a warrant conversion where there was a bunch of warrants that they had issued previously where they then they converted those warrants into stock and Plug Power received some cash for that. Plug Power received some cash as a result of this conversion. So they raised $355 million from this warrant conversion. But this also increased their share counts. They had to issue 340 million shares. So their share counts increased from 1.2 billion to 1.55 billion. So just from this one warrant conversion, their share count increased by approximately 30%. Now they did raise this did get them some cash. So their cash balance it was 166 million at the end of the third quarter. they got this $355 million from the warning conversion. So that brings their cash balance up to $521 million. However, just in the first nine months of 2025, they already burned $500 million. And that's even despite them running down their inventory. So they are burning cash at a rate of like $650 million a year approximately. So this $500 million of cash that they have now is probably only going to get them through the first half of 2026 at which point they are going to need to raise even more capital and probably resulting in further dilution. Now Plug Power they previously had multiple outstanding loans in November. So also subsequent to quarter end in November of 2025 they refinanced a bunch of their loans. So they basically consolidated their loans into one big loan of and that's basically the only loan they have on their balance sheet now. And this is a $431 million loan that has a that is a convertible bond. So that this loan can convert into stock at a $3 strike price and it carries a 7% interest rate. So but it does not mature until 2033. So that's eight years away. So they do in addition, you know, to their massive cash burn, they also have this massive loan that they're eventually going to have to repay, but the maturity is pretty far out. So this is not really this is not really an an imminent risk for the company, but just something to keep in mind. And now finally, we're going to discuss in a little bit greater detail that this AI data center narrative that Ryan alluded to at the that Ryan alluded to earlier in the video. So on November 10th, Plug Power put out this press release saying Plug Power to generate over $270 million through monetization of electricity rights and operational efficiencies supports major US data center buildup. So obviously now with AI and everything and there's all these data center companies building new data centers to support AI and this is kind of the hottest investment has been the hottest investment theme over the past couple years and Plug Power wants to jump on this bag bandwagon and pretend like there's some kind of AI beneficiary. But if you read the the details of the deal, it's all very vague. So they say, "Plug Power has signed a non-binding letter of intent to monetize its electricity rights in New York and one other location and collaborate with a U with U with a US data center developer. The project developer is actively expanding its data center platforms across the country and Plug Power will work with them to explore providing auxiliary and backup solutions utilizing plugs advanced fuel cell technology. So there's kind of two aspects of this. First is the monetization of Plug Powers's electricity rights and the second thing is they're potentially looking at providing plug power hydrogen fuel cells as backup auxiliary power. So the first the first part of it, the monetizing electricity rights. So Plug Power was planning to build this green hydrogen facility in New York. And the the way that this green hydrogen production facility would work is you know you take water you basically put electricity into it and then that turns into hydrogen. So you need a lot of electricity to operate a green hydrogen production facility. So Plug Power they secured contracts with the electric utility companies in New York and that electricity contracts that they had secured they were intending to use for their green hydrogen production. But now they're saying there's this data center company that really wants to build this data center in New York and they need electricity and there's I guess a shortage of electricity. So Plug Power is going to cancel its green hydrogen production facility and then they will and then they will sell their power they will sell their electricity purchase contract at a premium to this data center company. That I believe is what they're saying. However, this is a non-binding letter of intent. So nothing has actually happened. The D this data center, this unnamed data center operator, they have not actually committed to anything. They just signed a piece of paper saying, "Oh, we'll look into maybe purchasing Plug Powers's electricity rate. Also, they say Plug Power to generate over $275 million." But this $275 million is very vague. They say it is expected to generate more than $275 million in liquidity improvement through a combination of asset monetization, release of restricted cash, and reduced maintenance expect and reduced maintenance expenses. So, this is a very vague statement. They get $275 million in liquidity improvements. So, they're not even going to get $275 million of cash from this data center company. What it sounds like is there's a bunch of costs that are associated with building this green hydrogen production facility in New York. And if Plug Power cancels that facility because they're instead going to sell the electricity rates to this data center company, well, that reduces their obligations and the amount of money that they would have to pay to build that hydrogen production facility. So that $275 million is not actually cash that they're receiving. It sounds like basically the savings that they will acrue by cancelling the construction of the green hydrogen production facility. But again, this is all none of this is guaranteed because it's still just a non-binding letter letter of intent. And then they say we're going to explore potentially this data center company is going to explore potentially buying some plug power fuel cell generators as backup power for their data centers. But again, it's a non-binding letter of intent. It means almost nothing because no deal has been signed. So overall, I think this is basically a giant nothing burger. This whole thing is probably BS because it's just a non-binding letter of intent. so it's probably it may not even ever come to fruition. So Plug Power over the years, they have had so many different narratives that they've tried to sell. So this company was founded all the way back in I think like 1998. So it's been like almost this company has been around for like more than 25 years and they have tried to do many different things. So first they were going to make a first that they they were going to make a stationary hydrogen fuel cell generator. Then they're going to make forklifts. Then they're going to start producing their own hydrogen. Then they're going to sell electrolyers. Now they're doing they have this non-binding letter of intent with a data center company. They always have a new narrative that they try to get investors excited about to to try to increase their stock price. But every single thing that they have ever tried has resulted in massive losses because hydrogen as a technology is not economically viable. And we can see if you want to understand the plug power story, you just need to look at these two charts. The first chart is Plug Power stock price, which is basically, you know, sometimes there's pumps. Sometimes it'll it'll pump up for a few months, but it always goes down. The trend of Plug Power stock is always going downwards. And the reason the stock is always going down is because the company loses so much money that they have to issue they have to issue new shares to fund their losses. And as the share count explodes, this dilution c puts downward pressure on the stock price. And I expect this to continue going forward. So that about wraps it up for everything we had to talk about plug power today. As always, if you have any opinions or thoughts about plug power, please let us know in the comments section below. And we will see you all on next week's video.
