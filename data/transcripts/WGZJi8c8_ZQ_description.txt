From Brexit and the European Union to global diplomacy, former UK Prime Minister Theresa May speaks with Francine Lacqua about her time at the pinnacle of British politics and her approach to leadership in a world she says often rewards the loudest voices. 

May reflects on her "steep learning curve" when former Conservative leader David Cameron appointed her home secretary, including having to respond to a series of terrorist attacks. 

May, who started her career at the Bank of England, also discusses the future of her own party at a time when Nigel Farage's right-wing Reform party is rising in the polls, and the threat Vladimir Putin poses to the world. "Strongmen," May says, cannot be allowed to proliferate at the expense of multilateral institutions.
