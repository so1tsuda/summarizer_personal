Meet Matt Hagger, Founder & CEO of Taletree and a veteran serial entrepreneur who spent 25 years building companies from the UK to Silicon Valley. He was the mind behind Zkatter, a visionary photo-sharing app that predicted the rise of Instagram and TikTok before the world was ready.

What happens when you build the right product at the wrong time? And how do you find the courage to start over after a brutal failure? In this video, Matt opens up about the reality of the "25-year overnight success." He discusses why failure is actually the best armor for the future, the importance of maintaining a "kindergarten mindset," and his new mission to protect human creativity in a post-AI world. From working with the original Android team to founding Taletree, Matt shares the raw, unfiltered truth about what it really takes to survive as a founder.
