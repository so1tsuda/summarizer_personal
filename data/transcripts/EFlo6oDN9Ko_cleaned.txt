Today's number 54. That is the percentage of men who have some form of facial hair, up from 42% 10 years ago. According to surveys, most men don't actually like their beard at first, but then it grows on them.

>> Okay.

>> Oh, I was supposed to Oh my god.

>> No, no. If you don't find it funny, then that's just what we do. So,

>> I did, but it was a delay. It was a delayed reaction. I did find it funny.

>> Welcome to Propy Markets. Scott is still on vacation, but we are back in action and we are kicking off the year with the one and only Josh Brown, co-founder and CEO of Rhett Holtz. Josh, welcome back to the show. It's great to see you.

>> Great to see you. I apologize for dressing like the great and powerful Oz. I didn't pick up on it until I saw myself on a video screen. That's That's what I'm That's the energy I came into the year with.

>> I love it. You're looking good. How was your How was your holiday? How was your new year?

>> So sick. Oh, yeah.

>> So great. I You know what? I've been in Florida for 2 weeks. I have a tan.

>> You look good.

>> The weather sucks here predictably, but like it's not even bothering me. I just I had an amazing couple of weeks for the holidays and I feel good. Ready for 26. ready to rumble, ready for 2026. Okay. Well, let's get right into it. , lot of questions I want to ask you. , we haven't had you on since the summer and a lot has happened since then. We had the government shutdown. We had rate cuts. We had this AI bubble story which kind of got huge. A lot of people were talking about it. , just as you look back on 2025 and what's happened since we last spoke, just a pretty general question. What have been your biggest takeaways? I think the key thing was not getting too negative in November when Oracle was blowing up and it seemed like this was going to be like this this comeuppance for all the data center spend and all of a sudden like the floor was about to fall out from under all of us and like if you fell prey to that narrative which obviously a lot of people so there's two categories there are people that fell prey to it because they are just nervous by nature or they tend to fall for all of those types of like bouts of negativity. But then there's another camp of people that really did want it to fall apart. They wanted it to crash.

>> and you know, some of that is like political, some of that is people who missed out on the AI trade for the last 3 years, but like whatever. You just have this huge chorus of people warning you like this is the next year 2000 and it's dot com, you know, 2.0. 0. But I think the key to this year was not falling prey to it. And if you were able to stay the course, like we're talking right now, the Dow is going to have its first close, I think today, above 49,000. And the NASDAQ looks incredible, , you know, through the end of last year and now into the first week of this year. And I think it's really, it's tough sometimes when everyone is screaming bubble, bubble, bubble. it's really tough to like, you know, stay the course and stick to your guns. But that really was the key to the to the fourth quarter.

>> Which part of those bubble fears do you take issue with? Cuz you know you know we were talking about it a lot on this podcast and there were several moments which I think were substantial and they were legitimately concerning. I think the biggest one was probably what we saw on Brad Gersonner's podcast where they asked Sam Alman about the revenue and the amount that they're going to spend. The fact they want to spend $1.5 trillion, they've got $13 billion in revenue. And then we saw kind of the worst response we've ever seen from a CEO, the CEO of a company on which a lot of the momentum in the market really depends on. So, you know, we weren't saying it was doomsday on this podcast. We were trying to be rational about it, but it was something that we were worried about or that we thought was at least significant. I guess from your view, which part of the bubble story was wrong or misguided? Well, no. We still may end up having a bubble, but I look at price. I look at I look at valuation. I look at all the things that classically you're supposed to look at. And the stock market just was not going along with the story that this is all coming to an end. If you looked at the way semiconductor stocks were acting, they just they were not giving into that narrative. And if you like I so I'm one of the people that comes on the show with you and you know my big my big thing that I try to get across when I can what I'm trying to convey is that prices are more important than opinions and prices represent the sum total of people who actually manage money and are voting with their money. So again I think there's a lot of wish casting a lot of people want to see open AI in the private market. somehow like burst into flames. A lot of people want to see Larry Ellison and Oracle have a have a comeuppance. Like a lot of that's wish casting is people saying they think that's going to happen, but what they're really saying is I want this to happen. And if you were looking away from Oracle CDS prices, which I don't think are particularly important, , but if you were looking at actual share prices for Nvidia and Broadcom and Corning, which makes the fiber optics for all the data centers, and you were looking at, you know, you definitely saw stocks come down, but you did not see stocks plunging, stocks crashing. That's not how the real money was betting. And here we are just a couple of weeks out of that and most of those stocks have recovered. The SMH looks amazing. I think 86% of the names in the SMH semiconductor ETF are above their 50-day moving average. That didn't take long. So, I think it's really important when you hear people pounding on, you know, with a with a wooden spoon on a pan talking about bubble, ask yourself why are they doing it? Are they in the content business? Okay, they're doing it for attention. They're doing it for clicks. I get that. That's There's nothing wrong with that. Everyone's got to make a living. , are they money managers who are overweight small cap value underweight tech? Okay, I get that, too. They're wish casting. They want these stocks to blow up so they can call their clients and say, "You see, I was right. I'm not a schmuck. I told you that. I told you so." , so there's a lot of that going on. , obviously people on financial television, it's high ratings when stocks like Oracle blow up. And then the next one and the next, they want that domino effect because this is when people are paying the maximum amount of attention to financial media. So there are a lot of people who have a vested interest in seeing this thing go badly and maybe it will, but I think it becomes really important to say, all right, who's talking about this? that's actually invested. Who's talking about this that literally has money on the line, reputation on the line, that has skin in the game? I want to listen to those people. Not that they can't be wrong, but my god, I need a counterbalance to all the Chicken Littles and all the people saying the end is nigh because without that counterbalance, you're just listening to people who are wish casting. What I would say in push back is, you know, you're describing a dynamic where there are certain people who have a vested interest in things going down, but on the flip side, there's also people who have a vested interest in things going up.

>> Yes.

>> And everyone has vested interests. Everyone has things that they want or internal biases. They want things to go right. Maybe they want things to go wrong. And I think to your point, it is so important to figure out how to kind of weed through that.

>> My point is when in doubt, follow price.

>> When in doubt, trust what the markets are saying about the price of a stock.

>> Pay less attention to what people say and more attention to what they do.

>> Fair enough. I think that's definitely true. on open AI as an example. So I feel like we need to kind of bucket these companies into into buckets basically.

>> Totally true

>> where you do have many of these AI related stocks which I think are growing pretty healthily and they're managing their balance sheets well and everything looks pretty good. And then I think there are other companies like OpenAI which I honestly I mean maybe I'm one of those wooden spoon banging against the drone but I don't look at what OpenAI is doing from a financial management perspective and it I don't think it inspires much confidence in me personally. And the trouble is I can't follow the price because it's private. So I actually don't know what the price of Open AI is. But if I had to guess based on what we're seeing in the public markets, I would probably look at Oracle as a proxy for what's going on with Open AI and it's not looking very good. So in that sense, OpenAI doesn't seem to be the best reflection of what is happening in AI right now. I have so much other stuff I want to ask you, but I am just interested in this topic. Would you agree that we need to divide it up?

>> I think you're exactly right. It's a very unique situation where one of the most important chess pieces is not on the board. This it's it's highly unique situation. I've likened it in in other venues. I've explained it as Kaiser So in The Usual Suspects.

>> Sam Alton limping off.

>> It's the main character in the movie. It's the thing that animates the actions of everyone else in the movie. And he doesn't show up until the last one minute of the film. In old Hollywood, they used to call it the McGuffin. So the Maltese Falcon. The What is the Maltese Falcon? It's a stupid statue, but it's the McGuffin. It's the thing that sets everything else in the movie in motion. Open AAI share price is not tradable. Now, of course, there are people who are invested in it. But even if they on a Monday they're bullish, on a Tuesday they're bearish. They don't have the liquidity to change their mind and act on that price in the way that we have in the public market. To which I would respond to you, I'd say you're exactly right. Thank God for public markets number one. because yes there is a lot of concern about open AAI and we saw it viscerally in the prices of the companies that were deemed to be quote open AAI dependent companies that OpenAI is spending the most money on their services and Oracle sort of became like an avatar for that. But let me ask you a question. Anthropic, one of the biggest players in AI, also private, , spends about5 billion dollars annually that we know of on, , the AWS cloud to support its business. Anthropic is actually ahead of Open AI in enterprise. , they're selling to thousands of the largest organizations and corporations around the world. , we don't have a share price for that one either. You think you think Anthropic is in as big of a draw down from its high as the public share price of Oracle is? Probably not. Amazon actually consolidates some of the profit from Anthropic is doing as a very large shareholder of the company. we think that business is gang busters. So yes, you have to bucket these things, but then you also have to realize narratives in AI are shifting overnight. Seven months ago, the talk around Alphabet is that they're finished. They're done. They're going to get murdered by o by OpenAI and other LLMs. People are going to start their searches on Perplexity and Claude and Chat GPT and completely bypass the Google experience. And then Google goes up 65% on the year, becomes the best performing of the Mag 7, and all of a sudden it's Google's world and the rest of us live in it. That shift didn't take three years. It took like three months. So the narratives and the banging on pots and pans has to give way to the primacy of price. What are people actually betting on with real money versus who is wish casting and just hoping the guy they don't like goes down for the count, right? Oh, I don't trust Sam or I hate Elon or it's so important to focus on price more than ever. not to try to sit here and parse 50 different people's opinions. That game is almost impossible. The real game is okay, fine, but what are the buyers doing? What are the sellers doing?

Based on everything you've you've told us here and what you've seen in 2025, let's look ahead to 2026. , we've been having a lot of different commentators on telling us their predictions for the year. We've gotten kind of a range of opinions. , what are your predictions for markets this year? Are you bullish on 2026? Are you bearish and why?

>> So, we're money managers, not sellside analysts and not chief strategists. So, we don't have price targets. We don't have our own internal earnings expectation. What we do for clients is we rationalize the risks they're taking with data. We try to give them the historical context that we think is more important than the prediction of the of of the month or of the day these days because we're in the January where everyone's making their year-end predictions. But this is what I would share with you. The only questions that matter for this year. Number one, will the fundamentals continue to justify an above average price earnings multiple? That's it. That's the question. You either answer that yes, no, maybe, or let's say yes, no, I don't know. So, of course, like obviously I don't know, but I think the answer is yes. Why do I think the answer is yes? Well, the first earnings season we'll have is Q4. We'll start getting these reports in February. And here are the consensus estimates. You tell me what you think when I'm done. Wall Street thinks the S&P will deliver an 8.6% 6% earnings growth quarter versus Q4 of 2024. Okay. They think the technology sector which is obviously the most important sector for earnings growth and also for market capitalization will do 25.8% earnings growth. That's an eyepopping number. If they do 24% or 27% or anywhere in that vicinity, wouldn't you agree that would support a 21 multiple on the overall S&P given how important those companies are to market cap? I like that's what I would say. , you're not getting that across the whole S&P. You're getting that in tech and a lot of that's coming from semiconductors. Okay, fine. But the number is the number. We don't put asterisks on any other year for the S&P 500. Why would we all of a sudden put an asterisk? Now, here are the full year 2026 consensus estimates for sectors, the big sectors that matter. Wall Street thinks industrials will do 13.1% earnings growth. They think technology will do 29.7 30% earn not revenue earnings growth for 26 again if they even get close. But here's what's really fascinating. Financials 10.4% 4% for 2026. Disc consumer discretionary huge sector. Amazon's in that sector. Tesla for some reason is in that sector 11.7%. communication services that's Alphabet, Meta, Netflix, etc. 7.2%. So like if healthcare 8 and a half, utilities 8.7, that's become a deacto AI trade. So, the consensus thinks the S&P 500 will grow earnings once again for all of calendar 2026 by 14.6%. So, with a typical beat rate, it'll probably be more like 15 16%. If you think the market delivers that 21 times earnings is justifiable and so it doesn't mean we'll get another, you know, 18 20% return on the S&P, but at the very least, we should have a lot of winners in the market. 16 stocks of the S&P doubled last year. These aren't obscure, bizarre stocks no one's ever heard of. Some very big stocks doubled last year. All sorts of stocks went up 30, 40, 50, 60%. And I want you to remember the stock market wasn't cheap a year ago at this time. So the earnings growth has to deliver. So the real question that we need to answer is will it?

>> Yes,

>> I think it will. And there's a chance that's wrong. You could have some sort of an exogenous shock that changes everything. So, you have to just be like okay with that. That's the risk that we're all taking because just for fun, go read the January 2020 year ahead outlooks from Wall Street. How many of them were talking about Corona virus? Zero. Hundreds of outlooks. Zero. And that obviously changed everything. Stock market ended up going up by the way. , but I'm just making the point like the thing that could alter the course of 15% earnings growth this year is not really the thing that any of us could put our finger on. Now, a lot of people would say, "Oh, it's going to be the AI data centers. They're going to slow down. There's going to be another Oracle, blah blah." Okay, possible. , but right now that's just not I wouldn't say that's sort of like what should be anyone's base case that all of a sudden all this money that these companies have spent they're going to say, you know what, forget it. It's it's just unlikely to me. So that's where I am on 26.

>> I think that makes a lot of sense and I I appreciate I think it's a really good framework. Let's just focus on the fundamentals. Are the fundamentals going to grow in 2026? and a lot of indicators would say yes they will beyond just the numbers itself that itself that Wall Street is projecting but the fact that we do have interest rates coming down the fact that we're going to see more deficit spending having said that on the AI front I think one of the questions that I'm thinking about and that a lot of people are thinking about is we've seen all of this unbelievable spending and as you say it is mostly coming from the semiconductor industry That's sort of where the action is happening and that's what's kind of driving growth at this point. But I think the question then becomes will we see the ROI on those chip and data center investments? Like is it the case that all of the money that Meta is spending on the data centers and that Alphabet spending on the data centers, all the money that they're spending on these chips, are we going to see that reflected? Are they going to get a real return on their investment in the what I would say the real economy which is the consumer economy? And for that we kind of have to look at companies like Anthropic. We have to look at companies like OpenAI and we have to figure out how much are people actually willing to spend for this stuff.

>> Palunteer is your tell. Okay. Amazon is your tell. Alphabet. This is where the spending is literally happening. Corporations are not buying GPUs. Amazon and right like Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft are buying GPUs. Meta and why are they buying them? Because their customers want to be able to do more with their data. And that's how that works. So, you watch the data centers. I think I think everyone is. So that's not like a big revelation. You watch the Palunteers, the Accentur, you listen to their commentary, those are the companies that are actually assisting large enterprises with like okay great AI. What do I actually do with it? How like how does it help me beat earnings you know next quarter? Well, here's a project that you could work on right now. So like that's that's where the rubber meets the road is in that part of the market. look I think you look at the performance in sectors that have nothing to do with AI over the last year and you've seen like different sectors waking up. Biotech had an unbelievable comeback in 2025. What has materially changed in biotech? nothing other than the use of AI is probably a huge efficiency driver in phase 1, 2, and three clinical trials. It probably speeds up a lot of the things that have slowed those companies down in the drug discovery realm. That's the way Wall Street is starting to price in the AI opportunity in healthcare. Look at the financials, same thing. fraud detection, cyber security, like AI becomes a force multiplier in things that they're already spending money on if they could spend money more efficiently. And the last thing, and I know we're going to get to this, but at CES, Nvidia was able to show that they have done in one year what took Tesla 8 years to automate an automobile so that it could drive through the city of San Francisco without a human touching any of the steering wheel, gear, shift, brake, acceleration. , again, that's eight years of Tesla experimenting on the road. Nvidia has an offthe-shelf solution for every OEM in the world to turn their automobiles with a few sensors and a software package and and a chip package into an autonomous car. You know who Nvidia works with? Volvo, MercedesBenz, GM, Toyota, Jaguar, Land Rover, all of them are going to have access to minimum level two autonomous driving via Nvidia. They'll be able to catch up to Tesla like within a year, 18 months. Did think now you think about you say, "What's the ROI? Are you [ __ ] kidding me?" the ROI for these types of projects and we're not even getting into robots which is probably a late 2020s story like robots right

>> as like an ROI driver is probably 27 28 29 but like that is what the street is pricing in when it says it's willing to pay 22 times for the top 500 companies in the United States that's the mentality right now it's not what's the ROI it's oh my god I can't even imagine how big the ROI could be. It's all moving so fast. My dreams can't even keep up with the things that they're announcing. So, it's a very exciting time to be an investor. Not to lose your head. We It'd be a different If I said to you, the S&P's 45 times earnings like it's the year 2000. All right. It's a different conversation. But that's not what's going on right now. I wish it were. It would be It'd be more fun to talk about. It'd be a slam dunk bubble. we could all be short and get rich. It's just not that easy.

>> Yeah. I think the other the other piece of it is the timing of all of this. It's sort of like what is our time frame for when we're going to see that ROI and what are Wall Street's expectations for when that is all going to come through. And I think that kind of defines whether we see an implosion, whether we see a correction or some sort of crash or we don't. I'm with you. the ROI is going to show up at some point in some way and it'll be in a very big way.

>> Would you right now here's a thought exercise. I take away your LLM usage from your day. You're not a corporation. You're not a government. You're an individual. I say to you, no LLM for the next 30 days. What's your experience like relative to what you've just spent the last two years doing? It sucks. you're not going to stop paying for it. And then if I say, "Okay, you could have it back, but the only way you could have it back is you have to pay three times more than you were paying."

>> That's the question. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. That's what I want to know.

>> Oh, I'm fairly sure. If I took it away from you for 30 days and then said, "All right, you could have it back, but Chad GPT Plus is no longer 20, it's 40, or it's 60." You're probably paying it.

>> I think I probably am. I think. But that to me is the big question. And it's like and that's what the I guess as a sort of naturally maybe risk averse person which is not a good thing by the way. It's way better to be risk on risky. It's it's it's a better strategy in general. But I guess my point is and what I what I want to know is what is that price, right?

>> And I want to see it in the numbers like what are people actually willing to pay? What is this thing really worth? And can we see that happening? And I guess my response I just I don't quite know. And that's why I feel and I think probably others feel a little bit more hesitation this year. is that we don't fully know yet. We kind of are getting a sense. We're beginning to get a sense. We're beginning to see the ROI begin to get reflected in the numbers, but we haven't fully realized it. I think there's already been a behavioral transformation that cannot be reversed and I think that most knowledge economy workers have already very heavily incorporated AI tools into their daily workflows in ways that they might not even be aware that they've done because of the ways in which Alphabet has sort of inserted this stuff into all the services that we already use. There's AI all over Gmail. Well, there's AI all over Docs and Drive and I just and then you think about like for people that are heavily working in tech doing things like coding, no one's coding without a co-pilot at this point. So, I think there's been a behavioral change that's irreversible and I think that that grounds this AI spending story at least in something there's like a baseline. Yes. Okay. So that's really that's important. And Ed, you could not have said that in 1999. You could not have said that because nobody was actually making money on the internet,

>> right?

>> And it's funny, the first use case where people actually were willing to surrender a credit card number to any internet company was the purchase of online pornography. Like pornography is probably the thing that got AOL to profitability. Like honestly, it's a it's it's it's the thing that made the internet like a going concern. It was the only revenue.

>> It's what's going to get Open AI to profitability, right?

>> Perhaps. But I think this is very different from that. I think this is like it's already proliferated through corporate America. And then just regular people in the way that they look for information. Like my wife and her friends take pictures of things and ask chat GPT how much does this cost or does this look like I should take my son to the doctor or right like it's just it's become it's become ingrained behaviorally already. So we need to stop thinking about this as something that's about to abruptly end. And then I think you're asking the right question. It's like okay but what is it really worth? I don't know that there's one answer that makes sense for everybody, but it's I agree it's the right question. We'll be right back.

Based on this conversation, we're thinking about what's going to happen in 2026. I think it's probably going to be a huge driver of the narrative in 2026 as well. What else are you thinking about going into 2026 aside from AI? What are the big stories? is what are the big shifts that are going to really drive the market this year?

>> Well, it's profit margins and we hit record levels of profit margins this year and I think we'll do it again next year and that is mostly an AI story. So, I hate to like recursively keep coming back. , I think that's really it. It's so big, dude. It's so it's so big. Yes. The most incredible thing for next year is to see the S&P 493 stocks, not the MAG7, start beating earnings and crediting all these AI investments they're making. That's it. Like that's the whole that's the whole ball game. And I think that's what we're going to get.

>> What about interest rates? Are you focused on what we're going to see from the Federal Reserve? I mean, obviously Trump's going to pick his new Fed chair in May. Does that matter to you?

>> Not really. There are years in which the Fed is the queen on the chessboard.

>> I think the Fed this year is a bishop at best.

>> I just I don't think anywhere near as impactful. If we get one interest rate or three interest rates, I'm not sure that materially means a whole hell of a lot. One of the things we've learned over the last couple years, which I know you and I have discussed, is that high interest rates actually served as a form of stimulus for the top 20% of the country. people's bank accounts were gushing income in ways that they hadn't experienced in 15 years. there's just no evidence that what the system needs right now is a lot of rate cuts. There's also no evidence for any reason why we should expect to see rate hikes. So I think there will be a transition at the Fed. I don't think it'll be fire and brimstone. I don't think the new guy walks in with a mandate from the White House to take rates to zero. I just I think the most interesting thing happening at the Fed right now is what they're doing with very short-term repo markets just you know doing their best to maintain liquidity. Maybe that sort of becomes a story if we have a liquidity air pocket but outside of that I would not have the Fed on my bingo card as being a particularly notable player in what's to come this year.

>> What about deficit spending? We've got the big beautiful bill which is kind of going to go into effect this year. It's going to add nearly half a trillion dollars in some form of fiscal support. I assume that's just going to show up in earnings. Are you thinking about that? Do you think that will be a significant driver this year in markets as well?

>> No, I think the deficit is just something that you put on your list of risks to the market every year. If you're a chief strategist or a chief economist, you just like it's like an automatic. It's almost like putting China invades Taiwan. Like it's just like one of those like just pencil it in.

>> Well, I sorry. I mean it in a positive sense that this is just more money. We're just injecting more money into the system and so perhaps it will be a good thing.

>> The risk there is it's inflationary. but the prevailing trend right now in the stuff that really matters and my colleague Cali Cox who's actually out of the picture on maternity leave recently but like the big like her big concept that she tries to get across to people our investors is just like look there are blips in inflation for individual items but the prevailing trend is lower less exacerbated ISS issues in the labor markets, lower wage growth, lower commodity prices, filled up my car this morning at three, you know, a three handle for premium gasoline. rents are coming in, home prices are moderating. We do have, it's not at the speed the Fed would have liked, but we do have moderating inflation. all that stimulus that you referenced, all of that spending, all the infrastructure, is there a risk there that all of a sudden the inflation picture moderates at a slower pace or starts to scare people to the upside? Sure, it's definitely something that we can worry about. I wouldn't use that as a reason to not invest. , you know, it's it's on the list. Low on the list, but it's on the list.

>> Josh Brown sounds very bullish is what I would say,

>> but I always am. It's not it.

>> You always are. And I think I think I mean it seems as though your view going into 2026 is kind of stay the course more of the same. which you know is exactly what you kind of told us last year and that's exactly how you were rewarded for it. I mean we had a great year.

>> I'd love to show up and say we're at a turning point. I know I'm in the content game also, but I'm doing I'm doing this a long time. I've been bullish forever. My clients have been rewarded for that. , there are bare markets along the way. 2022 was not fun. We did our jobs as wealth managers in 2022. We had massive stocks like Meta and Amazon in 50 70% draw downs. Like that does happen. It's part of the experience of investing. Our approach is not to try to predict those moments. It's to help people get through them because what's on the other side is even higher prices, even more profitability, even better outcomes for people who are willing to bear risk. This is what we do and I think we're the best in the world at it. We are not the best in the world at calling turning points like that. I can't get I wish I could. I can't deliver that for you.

>> What would be your advice to young investors right now? I mean and I would just couch this in the fact that we've had for example Asswath Deodoran who we had on our podcast earlier this or early this year last year towards the end of last year. and it was one of the most strikingly bearish pods we've recorded where he was very I mean and this is not a person who loves to sound the alarm on stuff. I mean, he is a very calm, composed, measured investor. He tells everyone what he's doing and you can track his investments on his website, but he said that he is looking at selling and getting into collectibles because he thinks that everything is overvalued. Now, I don't know where he stands on things right now. This was this was you know some time ago but just given what everything we're seeing all the all the opinions out there what would be your advice to investors especially young investors going into 2026 right now how should you think about investing

>> do not get into collectibles Asswath is brilliant he's the dean of valuation they call him I understand he's he's looking at present valuations and he's looking historically and he's it's accurate when you buy at high valuations, prospective returns are lower. It's like an iron law of finance. The problem is we have seen a consistent ratcheting up of multiples over the last 10 years and companies have found ways to deliver higher than expected profits and this could be yet another one of those years. So I think the key thing for young investors is to pray for downside in the stock market to remember that they are forced investors, forced savers. If you are in your 20s or 30s, you have decades that you are forced to take a portion of your paycheck every two weeks and add it into a 401k. If you know that today, are you rooting for all-time highs? Are you mad? Have you lost perspective on like time and space? You want lower prices if you're young. So I have clients in their 20s. I have clients in their 80s. My clients in their 80s want higher prices. No [ __ ] They're cashing their investments out now and living off the money today.

>> My clients in their 20s, we have conditioned them. Don't root for record highs. Root for 20% corrections and then call me and tell me how you're going to get me more money into your account or I'll call you. So, you must, if you're in your 20s and 30s, stop rooting for record highs. I know it feels good. I know it's endorphins. Look what a genius I am. I bought Tesla at 300. It's 340. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. That's what you're rooting for. But you shouldn't be. What you really should be rooting for is a lost decade. A, it'll hurt your parents. I know you'll you'll get that shade in Freud. But B, you will be accumulating shares in the greatest corporations known to mankind at discounted levels from where they once sold. And when you're buying low, eventually the market goes back to its old highs. You don't get back to even. You slingshot ahead of where you otherwise would have been. So if you're listening to this, you're a young investor. You're not an old rich man like Scott Galloway. Stop rooting for record highs. Root for corrections. Root for lost decades because that makes you a lot more money over the preponderance of your investing career, which is decades long. Mine is too. I am an older gentleman. I am a forced buyer of stocks. I'm 48 years old, if you could believe that. I I can't touch my own 401k till I'm 65, 70 years old. I won't be withdrawing to my IAS until the last minute. So, I'm a buyer of stocks. I alltime highs are great for me. They make me look like a genius to my clients, but the reality is I'd rather buy low. So, it's it's a mindset shift. It's not about predicting what's going to happen.

Hey [ __ ] what do you think all these trillionaires are going to be doing with their money? They're going to be collecting priceless works of art and they have no taste. You see how Jeff Bezos celebrates his birthday on a on a yacht with people waving sparklers?
