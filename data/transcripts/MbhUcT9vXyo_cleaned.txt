The largest digital asset platform in the world is finally going public. We're not calling it crypto anymore or crapto. They're called Digital Assets. This company's the market leader in every key market they operate in and we really like leaders. The company's called Grayscale. However, there's some major problems with their IPO that half, okay, all degenerates don't see coming. And if you dabble in crypto funds, you're thinking about investing in some crypto ETFs, then this video is a mustwatch. How to analyze any IPO? Well, typically, IPOs represent growth companies, so they better have meaningful revenue growth. That's not optional. We want to look at who their key competitors are. What leadership position do they have? Maybe there are better options for similar exposure elsewhere. How big is the opportunity? Well, Grayscale says this is a $365 billion opportunity. That's certainly big enough. Most importantly, how does a company make money? What would you say you do here? This tells us what exposure we're getting. This is something that professional investors focus heavily on while a lot of retail investors don't. So, I like this market map that Grayscale put together. They call it mapping the digital asset universe. Now, when you look at the top there, under currencies and smart contract platforms, I like how they differentiate Bitcoin and Ethereum by these terms, that makes up 70% of the entire crypto market, those two coins. And I think you need to be careful here, when you start talking about tokenization. So, let's say you start to tokenize assets. Well, you don't want a double count there, right? Just because you tokenized $5 billion in real estate doesn't mean that the value of the entire crypto universe went up by $5 billion. And then under consumer and culture here you have what we call crapto, especially this pumped-up fun platform. I recently saw a piece where somebody was bragging how it's never been easier to print money by doing rug poles on the platform. The fact that sort of thing is just allowed seems ludicrous to me. But anyway, when we start scrolling down the Grayscale -S1, we come quickly to this section. They talk about their products, ETPs and ETFs. So, basically, funds. They have both passive and active around $34 billion worth. So we want to put that number into perspective. It sounds a lot on paper, but it's only about 1% of the total $3.3 trillion crypto market. And that market just so happens to be about 2.6% of the total equities market. So, Grayscale manages some ETFs, and here you can see they're actually pretty formidable. They're the 22nd largest ETF provider. They're hanging around popular names like ProShares, Wisdom Tree, Global X. So, they've fared quite well in terms of the amount of assets they've attracted and they also offer some private funds. So, when it comes down to it, they manage about $35 billion worth of digital assets. Now, at a 1% expense ratio, that means their revenues should be around $350 million. Well, when we look at revenues, we find something interesting here. They're actually a lot more. But, first of all, this revenue decline from 2023 to 2024 is quite concerning. We'd wonder if they're exposed to some degen volatility there. But what stands out immediately is that this is an extremely profitable business. So those numbers you see there that I've highlighted, those aren't gross margins. Those would be attractive if they were. These are operating margins. So this company's printing money. And I love this, the letter in their S-1 from the founder. He talks about money printer go burr. And he's talking about the economy. We should be talking about his platform. And whenever you have a situation where somebody's printing money, it attracts competitors like mad, sharks in a blue ocean. Now, when we keep scrolling through the S-1, we come across perhaps the most pertinent piece of information that you'll find, which is the weighted average management fee. Remember that we speculated that if it was 1%, they'd be making $350 million. Well, it's actually a lot more than that. And you can see here in 2023, it was actually upwards of 2%. And most recently, in the first nine months of this year, it's floated down to around 1.4%. And the first thing you'll note here is that this average fee has declined significantly over the past several years. And if we just took their assets under management, multiplied it by this average fee, then we can project what their revenues might be. We can compare those to actuals. And look, it's spot-on. So this is a very easy business to follow, right? The assets under management multiplied by their expense ratio gives you their revenues. And this is where things start to become problematic. So when we look at their assets under management, 70% of those are found in two ETFs, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF, 88% of their revenues come from these two ETFs. And what you need to remember here is that the size of these ETFs is going to depend on two things. First, the price of the underlying asset. So in this case, the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum, plus the inflows and outflows. So investors have been pulling money out of these ETFs presumably because their fees are atrocious. And when you look at outflows last year, they had $25 billion in outflows. That's not good at all. Essentially, you're losing market share. In the first nine months of this year, they had another $3.5 billion in outflows. This is very problematic. It's very concerning. And when you look at the largest crypto ETFs out there, we've pulled up this list from Vetify. You can see where these two ETFs sit. Oh, look at the top there. iShares Bitcoin Trust. So, they're absolutely dominating this space. When Bitcoin ETFs first came out, we did an analysis on them and looked at all the players. ARK was in there. Well, now it looks like we indeed have a winner in iShares. That's no surprise at all. BlackRock dominating, as usual. Now, when it comes to fund investing for degenerates, the beginner level is "muh portfolio needs this ETF cuz Tom Lee said I should invest in it." These people usually buy high and sell low. Then there's the DGEN that eventually realizes that the asset that they're holding ought to reflect the value of its contents. This idea of net asset value. That's when a basic understanding of NAV happens. So, then, you'll see people make excuses as to why a fund ought to trade above NAV. It never should. If it does, then just go buy the underlying asset. It's silly, right? That happens because of hype and because of idiots. {you just blowing from stupid town.} And then you need to start asking, well, how much are you paying the owners of this vehicle to provide you this exposure? This is not really something DGens has started questioning yet. They haven't gotten that far, but institutions certainly are. And that's where we can pull up this same list of crypto ETFs and start looking at fees. Wow, is this telling? So, look at how expensive the Grayscale offerings are compared to the competition. This is a big problem. And they're not going to be able to sustain their AUM. They're going to keep seeing outflows unless they drop their fees, which is going to impact revenues, which is why you have essentially flatlined revenues. So, just to summarize here, Grayscale is printing money simply by managing money. Their fees, while declining over time significantly, are still very, very expensive. Nothing's going to stop large ETF providers like BlackRock from undercutting them on price. They could even use these vehicles as loss leaders, frankly, to attract institutions. I would go so far as to say nothing justifies these expense ratio premiums that we're seeing. I'd challenge people to put up some evidence otherwise. Why should investors be paying so much for these funds? They shouldn't. But most importantly, the problem here is going back to our initial set of screening criteria for IPOs, their revenues appear to be flatlining. Frankly, even declining. So if you look at 2023, 2024, and a 2025 estimate we've provided here based on that $35 billion in AUM they claim against the 1.39% expense ratio, you see they're going to be declining this year as well. Now, if you go into their S-1, I like how they point out the risks. They do a very good job of highlighting the many problems in the crypto space. They talk about how, from 2021 to 2023, the entire value of crypto dropped 62%. They point to all the major crypto companies that ended up liquidating. In some cases, fraud was involved. The amount of fraud in this space is just incredible to believe. And then they talk about this recent cascade of forced liquidation. So approximately $20 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated following a sudden drop in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. And look, here's the sudden drop, a massive crash, right? So, if there's ever actually any real significant volatility in the crypto space, then I guess, then people are just absolutely toast because they're not managing risk appropriately in probably what is, if you can call it an asset class, one of the most riskiest asset classes I've ever seen. So, when it comes to people that are looking at this company, I don't know what will happen to the stock once the IPO happens, but we can certainly take a poke at valuation. So, let's use those predicted 2025 revenues of $487 million. What we can then do is start looking at various levels of price to sales and, sort of, predicting a market cap. Now, for those of you who follow our own internal simple valuation ratio, which is market cap divided by annualized revenues, price to sales isn't much different. And since we don't have last quarter's revenues, we can just use 2025 predicted at a price to sales of three. They'd have a $ 1.5 billion market cap. An average price to sales would probably be around seven. That gives them a market cap of 3.4 billion. You double that, you get to 6.8. And anything above $10 billion would be too rich. Well, guess what? Industry analysts are projecting potential valuations of $30-33 billion. So, way overpriced. Now it's going to trade under the ticker GRAY for those of you that are interested. We always get the lazy DGEN leaving the "this aged well' comment. One of my insightful contributions to humanity. The reality is that nobody knows how this stock is going to react at IPO time. The fintwats are likely going to hype this up for no good reason. And what will end up happening is a lot of people decide to play musical chairs with this momentum stock if it turns out to be one. And that's a very bad idea. You always want to focus on the company that you're investing in. Think about two things here. What exposure are you looking for when you invest in Grayscale? Let's assume digital assets cuz that's the exposure you're getting, right? Largely exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Are there better ways to get that exposure? Yes, there are. You could just buy Bitcoin and Ethereum, for one. But Coinbase might be a better pick-and-shovel play because they have diversified revenue streams. Again, if you want exposure to the two mechanisms that dictate most the success of Grayscale as it lives today, then invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now, if you want greater exposure to crypto as an asset class, we did this really cool piece that looks at how you can build your own crypto ETF and not pay these extravagant fees. Give that a watch next. Thanks so much for taking the time to watch this today.
