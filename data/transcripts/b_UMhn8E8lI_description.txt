If an AI Mathematician can reason and prove on its own, how will the future change?

Carina is a mathematician and the Founder and CEO of Axiom. She started the company at 24, and Axiom is building an AI Mathematician with a $64M seed round at a $300M valuation.

Through years of research, she developed strong taste and intuition for hard problems. In this video, Carina explains why AI Mathematicians matter. Math research involves long periods of being stuck. Progress is slow. Rewards are delayed. Judgment and speed make the difference. This conversation is about building in uncertainty, choosing hard problems, and amplifying human thinking instead of replacing it.
