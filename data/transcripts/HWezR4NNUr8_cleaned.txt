Has Donald Trump just pulled off the most brazen oil heist in history?

>> The challenge in Venezuela is much more complicated because the actual reserves, though on paper there are a lot, it's actually very difficult, heavy, dirty, and expensive oil to process. It's expensive to get out of the out of the ground and process and ultimately produces a lower grade of oil that get gets you less money per barrel in the marketplace. and so it's not very attractive and it's very capital intensive. So all of those reasons suggest it'll be even harder. And let's remember that the risks are above ground. There are many political, regulatory, and legal risks that complicate the Venezuelan environment because they've had not one but two waves of expropriation and government intervention in the in the sector that have made big oil quite wary of getting involved further. It's possible he might be able to get more oil out of Venezuela and to seize it for American purposes, which seems to be the news of the day. , but that's far from saying the million or so barrels a day ner that we're at can return to a 3 million plus peak where Venezuela used to be at its in its prime. there's really no reasonable prospect of that anytime soon. And short of a hundred billion dollars plus of enthusiastic investment by big oil. That ain't going to happen. And you mentioned VJ expropriation. So I think we needed to have a little history lesson. and you know this goes back to the strong man that preceded Nicolas Madro, Hugo Chavez, who I think you're you know more familiar with than maybe some of us.

>> He actually came into the Economist headquarters, our old tower in St. James's to meet with me and the editor and chief of the day and other editors and brought in an entourage of 50 people. there were so many people in fact they streamed out of the boardroom and in the elevators had to run several times to bring them up to the building and he was singing a folk song during the entire time. For the first 15 [laughter] minutes, he didn't speak. He just sang a song to the editor-inchief, which was very curious moment. But the first time I encountered him was a couple of days after he bombed the presidential palace in Karacas and the Democratic president of the day and I were having an interview and I could still see the you know the bullets and shards of a failed coup attempt and that president Carlos Andres Perez was saying what are we going to do about this Chavez problem? This is going to be a real problem for our country. And of course he was right. and that era that came when ultimately Chavez succeeded taking over the country and running it really into the ground.

>> So let's talk a little bit about the differences in oil that you mentioned there before. So you've got the heavier form that you find in Venezuela. You've got lighter forms which are found elsewhere in the world and you know the shale oil in the US is a lighter form. What's the merit of wanting the heavier form as well? Is there any sort of reason for this? It sounds like it's more difficult to get out of the ground. It's more difficult to process. Why would you want the heavier form too? One truism about oil is that ultimately once refined, oil is a funible global commodity. Every barrel of oil is roughly substitutable for every other barrel of oil. Now, they might require some adjustments at your refineries or different additives along the way. Having said that, the details matter and the kind of mucky stuff that comes out of Canada in the form of tar sands, particularly Venezuela in the form of its or coal belt, the part of the country where most of this oil is and where most of it is hard to extract, requires a different kind of refinery with different processing equipment. It's dirtier, it's more carbon intensive, it's more emissions intensive. The reason it's attractive to the US is that because of the long-term positive relationship the US had with Venezuela back in the day before expropriation and in some of the years after the American Gulf Coast where many refineries are have been optimized for that kind of crude. So they would be immediate beneficiaries if this again mucky unpleasant expensive and dirty kind of oil were to make its way to the Gulf Coast. Those refineries are happen to be set up to handle it. it would be a windfall for the companies in America who presumably are looking forward to that short-term windfall. Beyond that, there isn't really much to say in favor of this kind of oil other than ultimately you can make it into petrol that can move a car. And VJ, as you hinted at earlier, you know, Trump's plan hinges on getting private capital, private oil companies to come back into Venezuela, , having been kicked out, you know, a generation ago and to do capex that would require them to plan a decade into the into the future. I mean, it just seems rather dicey, doesn't it? First of all, there have been two waves of in effect nationalization or expropriation, government intervention. the first round in the 70s Exxon and Shell basically built the country's energy sector. Exxon has been likes to joke it's it's had its assets stolen twice first back in 1976. and there was a little bit more of an amicable process in the sense that you know no company likes to have its assets taken but they were compensated. Exxon even stayed on as a contractor. So the relationship it was part of a global wave of nationalization. people saw the trend line and it had been acknowledged that maybe the seven sister oil companies, the big giants of the day, Exxon, Chevron and the others had very beneficial terms in the Middle East, in Iran, in and in Latin America. And so the political winds of nationalism were clear. They needed to bow and they did. However, the round of government intervention and expropriation that happened under Chavez, which came in the mid-200s, was hostile and the companies that were involved in that case, Chevron, Exxon, , Konico, they litigated and they did not take this kindly. Chevron actually decided to play ball and stayed. And to this day, they continue to be in , Venezuela. Maybe a third of their oil output today comes from Chevron. and both the Biden and Trump administrations have given them special dispensation to continue to do business even though the regime was an outlaw regime. they were given permission to deal with and continue their operations. So Chevron sits in a unique position.

>> So VJ, we've talked a little bit about the property rights issue. Outside of that, if you were able to sort of will into existence the correct conditions for some drilling to actually happen here, for some production to actually happen here, what else would need to be in place for this to actually work?

>> There's no doubt the most important factor is the oil price. that's the single most powerful determinant of whether companies invest or not. especially now that the big oil companies have all made strong commitments on shareholder returns to their to their boards and to their shareholders. And so at a oil price where we are today with the marketplace talking about even heading down to $50 a barrel, this is not an environment in which anybody wants to make investments, Venezuela may on some measures require $80 per barrel or higher on a sustained basis. Bear in mind these are investments that require 10 to 20 years worth of certainty in order to pay back. There's no investor in their right mind that in the soft outlook that we have today would would make significant investments in Venezuela for expansion of output.

>> I think it's easy to imagine the prospect that you know this is actually fairly short-lived in terms of their headline effect. I think it's very clear from the administration that they like immediate short-term winds. that they're probably less concerned with extremely long drawn out drilling and exploration operations and making sure that property rights in Venezuela are adequately protected over decades. it's a little bit more difficult to imagine, but I keep coming back to the fact that this is all completely different now because the US is a net exporter of energy. I remember watching the film W the Oliver Stone film about George W. Bush which sort of flicks between true to life and sort of deeply conspiratorial and there's a scene in it where I think it's Dick Cheney sort of stands up in the situation room and points at a map of the Middle East and essentially lays out America's imperial program and all the oil fields they would capture. In the mid-200s, that all felt very real in the sense that it did that the presumption was America is going to run out of oil, right? And it already needs so much oil from the rest of the world and this is a resource that's running out globally. And it felt really tense. And in this example, it feels a lot less tense, sort of a lot less important. , in large part because America is a wash with oil, more oil than it knows what to do with, , which is why it exports so much abroad. And Mike, it that's almost another tariff parallel, which is that this all feels a little old school, doesn't it? And we talked on the show about how, you know, Trump's view of tariffs is shaped in like the 80s by the scare about Japan. And that's a bit like how some of this, you know, let's go in and seize the oil because it's a scarce resource. Actually, no, it's not. America's a net oil exporter and the world's in an oil glut. And just Trump's not a man who updates his views. It's it's just you know just one of those facts of the world.

>> I think the other way in which it's similar to tariffs is that if you're the marginal driller in the US despite the fact that this is a political constituency that's pretty proTrump in general but that US policy explicitly is sort of screwing you over right first it was all of your capital equipment suddenly much more expensive. any non US labor that you want to use is increasingly going out of the window. And now you're being hit with this supposed attempt to generate lots of oil from countries outside the US where it doesn't provide US jobs. and it doesn't provide necessarily, you know, profits for smaller exploration companies. So yeah, it's it's funny because it's it's a sector that's that's yeah, got who they wanted in office and then sort of suffered from it really. go even further than that. I would say that big oil will come to regret its support for for Trump. and we saw in Trump 1.0, despite the drill baby drill rhetoric coming out and the attempts to roll back environmental regulations, more wind and solar was installed during that time, Trump won, than in all of American history prior. And we're going to continue to see big oil suffering under Trump 2.0 and continued decarbonization, increase in clean energies ongoing in America is my prediction. And so this will come to be seen not as the revival but maybe the the last gasp of a of a dying industry.

>> Well, that feels like a perfect place to leave it. VJ, thanks so much for walking us through all this.

>> My pleasure, gentlemen.
