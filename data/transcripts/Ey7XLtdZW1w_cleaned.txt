Did anything inspire you to write your new book?

>> So the new book I wrote it because I feel like just keep buying is a great philosophy for most people kind of want a different perspective or want to look at things differently and understand wealth building more holistically and like a bigger picture. That's what the wealth ladder is for.

>> The question is like does money buy happiness? And let's we looked at I looked at the studies on this. If you're already happy more money will bring more happiness, right? But if you're not poor and you're not happy, more money is not going to do a thing then.

>> What does wealth actually mean?

>> There's a lot of people that can live life on their own terms. That doesn't mean you have to be financially free. Like you can say, "Hey, my terms are I'm going to have this job. I'm going to go to work. I'm going to do this stuff, but on the weekends, I get to go and do this other thing that I really like and it doesn't pay me anything, but I just really enjoy it." And for me, that is wealth. Having the ability to go and do stuff you care about is wealth. Just to Keep buying. Just keep in Tommych. Thank you so much for joining us today. , in Japan, just keep buying has actually been bred even more widely than in the US and I heard that there are more than 200,000 copies sold in Japan and I really think that many readers in Japan here follow the ideas of your book very seriously. So today I'd love to talk about your new book, The Wealth Ladder, not just as a followup, but as a slightly different perspective. So I want to go beyond investing and to talk about work, spending, and also happiness as well. So you visited in Japan in 2024 on a personal trip and although this time we're online I'd love to keep that experience in mind as we talk especially in terms of how Japanese readers might approach this book. So to start and before I dig into the details of your latest book, can I ask you how you feel about just keep buying being so widely read in Japan? I love it and I'm obviously very grateful. I did not know that this would happen that it would take off in such a way and the Japanese readers would love it so much and it's been a pleasant surprise and it's even better because obviously after my wife and I visited she really loved the country and she can't wait to go back and she's always she's pregnant now so we're not really traveling much but she is telling me all the time we have to go back I'd go back again before I'd even go to a bunch of new countries. I'm like okay. So we do have a plan to go back at some point and we're very excited. to go back at some point. So, it's been it's been a lot of fun.

>> Oh, great. Great. Did anything inspire you to write your new book?

>> So, the new book I wrote it because I feel like just keep buying is a great philosophy for most people and for like people in, you know, most stages of their financial lives,

>> but I realize that certain people who are just starting out, it's not the right philosophy yet. And then for people who want like really extreme wealth, like you know, absolute what I say in the US is like over$10 million US, which is a lot of money. Anyone that's trying to get to that level of wealth, they need to go beyond just keep buying. And so it applies to, you know, a lot of different people and it's a good framework you can keep coming back to, which is why I like it. So like just keep buying is one of the strategies on the ladder. And so I basically said, hey, let's zoom out and look at other possible strategies. So that was the idea behind it. I wanted to come up with a new framework that people could come back to. I still think just keep buying is the perfect like starter book or helps most people. But for those people who kind of want a different perspective or want to look at things differently and understand wealth building more holistically and like a bigger picture, that's what the wealth ladder is for.

>> Oh, I see. So, let's deep dive into the details of the wealth ladder. So, what problem actually is the wealth ladder trying to solve? And you describe each level using the price of a decision and the 0.0.1% rule. what was your intention behind explaining the ladder in this way?

>> I think the idea with the ladder was I wanted to use it as a framework and then help it have it help you solve your income spending and investment choices, right? Help you with those choices, right? And so the idea here was,

>> you know, the analogy I used in the introduction was a a fitness instructor would give different advice to someone who's morbidly obese versus a well-trained athlete. Like the diet and exercise advice, a lot of the principles will be the same, but the specific strategy you follow is going to change based on where you are. And I think you can take that analogy and you can apply it directly to how you use your money, your wealth building, all that type of stuff. And so that's kind of where I came from when I was writing this. And in terms of like the spending piece, which you're talking about, the 01% rule, I think the reason why I have all these rules, I had, you know, rules for just keep buying. I have rules in the wealth factors because, you know, these rules work very well. And you don't have to follow all of them. I'm just throwing them as options. And you're like, "Oh, I like that one. Use it. If you don't like it, don't use it." Right? So I want to give people options and different ways of viewing their money so that they can make better choices. That's ultimately what all this is all about. And that's what I was trying to do with the wealth ladder.

>> I see. So in that sense, like level five and level six may feel distant for most people, but you say that they're still important for those at lower levels. So does that also mean that you're giving the options, right?

>> Exactly. I think for level five and six, obviously most people will never get to that wealth and they don't need to live a good life whatsoever. But I still think it's useful to think about some of the mistakes that people in level five and six make because those same mistakes overlooking your family, working so much that you don't have a social life or you don't do anything else, right? So it's like there are people that make mistakes in level fives and level six that apply to people across the wealth ladder. And I wanted to focus on those things and those people tend to do it because they focus too much on money. And so I was like, "Hey, what are some of these types of issues and how do they apply to everybody?" And so that's kind of what I tried to do in those chapters, even though like yes, I will probably never get to level five or level six. Most people won't and that's fine, but it's like what are the lessons that anyone can use if you're reading this book?

>> I see. So how about, you know, regardless of the level, do you think that the successful people share certain mental models or patterns of decision-m? I haven't studied like a bunch of successful people and tried to come up with, you know, some sort of mental model or decision-m. I do think the one, if I had to pick one thing, it's consistency. It's just focusing on consistency over a very long period of time. Now, the problem with that though is like it's very hard to find people who focused on something for a long time and were very unsuccessful, right? Because you would never know about them. They don't write headlines about, hey, someone tries to do something for 20 years and fails like miserable. don't you don't see those headlines, right? So, because of that, it's kind of hard to know what's actually true and what's not. I do think though the one thing that does seem to, you know, be somewhat similar across, you know, most successful people is some form of consistency. I also think that's why just keep buying did so well as a book. It's because it is about instilling that consistency like literally just keep buying over time and you can see a lot of progress in your financial life. And also early in the book you suggest choosing work based on three things. what you're good at, what you're interested in, what people will pay for. And I really love this quote. So could you briefly walk us through this framework?

>> Yeah. So there's this idea that you know how do you choose a job? How do you choose a career? What you're going to do with your life?

>> And I said these three things you can talk about your strengths, what you're good at,

>> your interests, kind of what you what you like are passionate about, what you want to pursue. And then lastly, what people will pay you for. If you have to start somewhere, everyone has to start. Unless you have money or assets or a family that can support you or someone that can support you, everyone has to start with getting paid first because you need to make some money just to get a financial base. But once you have a financial base covered, like then you can start exploring other options or on the side you can work on your strengths and just focus on the thing you're good at and see what you can do to get yourself interested in it. So, if I had to pick, like for most people, it's going to be they're going to just get paid initially. They'll save up some money and while they're doing that, they can work on their strengths and then, you know, the compliments and the praise they get from doing something they're good at, they can also start to get interested in it. And I think that's that's the framework I use in terms of my writing. I used to hate writing. It's very funny if someone wrote two books and I actually wrote them, right? This was prei I wrote the first one pre AI, so I didn't have a computer write it, right? No, nothing like that. But the thing is, I didn't used to like writing and I started to like it after I started really working on it and I started getting better at it and I was decent at it and it was a lot of the people saying, "Hey, you did a great job here with this article." And that kind of fueled me to keep writing. And so that's kind of where I'm coming from when I, you know, talk about these types of things. And so think about that as like the greater framework like of those three things, what can you focus on? And then build on those strengths and see where it takes you.

>> Well, yeah, that's that's very interesting. Well, you said that you didn't like writing. So, like in the school days, you didn't like writing essays or anything, right? I mean, what motivated you or to write at first point?

>> Yeah. So, I don't know what it how writing is taught in Japan to students and to children, but in the United States, it's like, hey, you need to write a 500word essay on this random book you read, right? And so I had to write a 500word or a thousandword essay on the Scarlet Letter. And I'm like, it's not that I didn't like the book. It's nothing like that, but I wasn't passionate about that. So most of the writing that is done for, at least in my experience in the United States for children is, hey, you need to write about this thing that I gave you versus, hey, what if I said, why don't you write a thousand words? Actually, you know what? There's no word limit. Write about anything you want that you're really interested in. Like what's your favorite thing? like write about your favorite cartoon or your favorite like you could get kids to write so much more if you let them write about what they want to write about. And guess what? I was a kid that never got to write about what I wanted to write about. And then at age of 27, I started writing about what I wanted to write about, which was personal finance. And that's kind of how this all started happening. And so

>> I'm not saying that's the solution to all these problems, but I think that's something where you can really start to see a change in someone's behavior based on, you know, how they're implementing it. Yeah, I strongly agree on that because I have the same experience in my elementary school days that I was forced to write something in the class, right? Yeah, I remember that.

>> Yeah, exactly.

>> Uhhuh. And you mentioned about the the side jobs as well in the book and but unfortunately in Japan not everyone can pursue side jobs due to employment structures and some of the restrictions. So within those limits, what realistic options can you can people take to climb the ladder

>> in the case where you can't do that because your employer is against I know like more traditional Japanese employers haven't always allowed that. I know they've started changing I think in 2018 they started to change stuff to allow for more side jobs and things like that.

>> In that case I guess you have to evaluate and I understand why they do this. They want you to show loyalty and say hey I work long hours because then you have a you're always going to basically have a job. So the question is like do you work harder and then try and move up in the company faster? Is that even an option? I don't know if that's is that a path that's available? That's one option. If you if that's not an option, have you considered getting another job where you could do something on the side? It there's a lot of things like that. And the other thing is you don't have to have a side hustle. Like you don't have to climb the if you're trying to climb as quickly as possible, you're going to need to find other income streams. But if you can't do a side hustle like through your job and you don't necessarily want to climb the ladder as quickly, then you can just keep your job and just keep doing this. Once again, the ladder is not meant to be climbed all the way to the top. That is not the goal of the l the wealth ladder. Like I presented it as a idea and I don't think everyone needs to climb it. I'm not saying you need to get to a certain level to be happy or anything of that sort. It's just more of a framework. And so if you're like if you're dissatisfied with your financial life, then we do need to look at some of these things and see what can you do. And if you're like, I can't leave my job. I can't start a side hustle. I have no way of making more income cuz I'm restricted. Then you've taken away any sort of lever we have. The only lever you have left is how you spend money. And I don't like using that lever. But if that's the only lever you have, then you have to change that to kind of get to yourselves to a point of more security so that you can maybe consider other options

>> in terms of the growth of the human capital versus the financial capital. how would you say that people should decide when to shift toward market investing from the human capital?

>> Yeah. So I think you know early on when you when you're starting out you always you know most people like oh I should focus on investing like yes get started it's always good but at the end of the day you're not going to have a lot of money yet and so your portfolio is not going to be throwing off a lot of return so you're not it's not going to be generating a lot of income for you right so where does that shift start to happen on the wealth ladder that's going to happen in level three which in the United States is like $100,000 to a million dollars US dollars I know in the Japanese version of the wealth ladder that's you it's going to be within yen and whatnot, but like it's just a different it's a completely different range. And that's where it's like, hey, at that point by that point, your portfolio is much larger. And that's really where it's going to start to make a difference in kind of how you do things, right? So that's where I'm when I think about this, it's like, okay, once you have maybe a few million yen saved up, then it's like, okay, that's a significant amount where I'm like, okay, that's definitely going to make a difference. And so I think thinking through where that is, that's where you're going to start to understand, you know, all the different facets of when investing is the right. And I think you'll know it because your investment portfolio will start to compete with how much you're earning, right? If you're like, "Oh, wow. I earned this. My investment portfolio earned this." Once it starts to get closer, that's the big moment when you know, hey, I need to focus more on investing.

>> Okay. So, it's not just a matter of age, but rather the balance in your portfolio that you're saying. Yeah, I would say it's more that competition between your earning power and your portfolio's earning power. And when you're starting out, your portfolio is earning basically nothing. And over time, it even if your income's still growing, this one should start to grow and it's going to compete with you. And then one day, you know, if you do really well, it'll surpass you what you can earn.

>> Right. Right. So here I'd like to briefly share what many Japanese investors are feeling right now. within inflation continuing in Japan and the recent expansion of the NISA program which the t tax exempt program many people feel a strong sense of pressure to start investing like almost the fear of being left behind if they don't act now. So for people who are approaching investing from this place of anxiety often without much financial and emotional margin what kind of mindset would you want to share with them?

>> I can understand the fear here because especially in Japan which for the last few decades the best one of the best things you could have done was just hold cash cuz that cash had very little inflation to even deflation where so it held its value for so long. So in that environment, you never need to invest, right? Why would you? You can just put in a, you know, you literally leave it under your mattress as they say, and that is just going to, you know, that's going to keep its value and you don't have to worry about it. In an inflationary environment, it's not true. When inflation's high, that value of those dollars or those yen are going down over time. And so you're kind of forced to participate to kind of keep that purchasing power around. And so I think what's happened and I could be wrong on this, but I'm feeling pretty good that like Japan has had a kind of a paradigm shift from CO and everything that's going on that now like inflation is here to stay. I'm not saying it's going to stay this high forever, but it seems like inflation is going to stay around, which means the old model is not going to work anymore. And so you have to think about investing. You have to think about getting allocated somewhat. What I would say is if you're worried about it, you don't need to put all your money into investments, put it all into the Nissa right now. That's not the goal. start just getting used to putting some money in there. Just get into a habit of putting a little bit and start small. I think the habit is going to be more important than the amount necessarily because you'll start putting some yen in there periodically and you'll start to see it grow and then if the market's doing well, it'll grow further. If it doesn't, it'll go down a little, but that's don't be worried about that. It's more about the long-term accumulation. You need to you need to start thinking in multi-deade periods. And that's kind of where you're going to see this. And it's and you don't just want to put it all in one stock or all in one market. You want to have it diversified as much as possible and you're going to start to see that pay off over a long period of time. So for the anxiety, I can't I don't know what it's like to grow up and live in that environment, but I can tell you from someone who lives in the environment that's very similar to like the current Japanese environment with normal inflation.

>> It's very regular to invest. It is not a It seems scary because you guys haven't done it for so long, but I'm telling you, us in the US have been doing it for over 100 years. It's very normal. Yes, the market can go down. that is a normal part of this.

>> It's just the this is how the games played in most developed economies. Japan, you guys had a very I would say non-normal period let's say in the '9s and 2000s and even to the 2010s a bit, right? So that was not how most asset markets work. So just keep that in mind when you're when you're investing or deciding to invest. So you mentioned and you emphasize the importance of diversification but when an asset performs well people tend to like fall in love with an certain asset and they tend to overconentrate. So how should we manage that temptation? You have to realize that. I mean, I love looking at these charts that show like over very long periods of time like which like the rank plots. It shows hey this asset was number one, this is number two, right? And then you can go and see in the next year it changes. And so these kind of asset quilts as they're called

>> and those plots are very useful or those charts are very useful because you can see the rankings change and an asset class that did very well in one period may do very poorly in the next. And so for example I remember in 2009 2010 everyone said US stocks are dead. Like they're done like international is better. You shouldn't even allocate to the US. US is a mess. And guess what? The US has been one of the best, if not the best performing market since 2010 in the world, right? Or, you know, it's the largest developed one, right? So, it's like just because something has a bad period doesn't mean it's always going to have a bad period. People have counted out Japan for a long time. And don't get me wrong, Japan had a very difficult period following the 89 peak. But look, now the market's up and now we're at new highs and the market's doing well. Does that mean it's going to continue forever? No. But it's very easy to discount something for forever. But things change. I mean, the world changes. Things that used to be true are no longer true. Things change. We don't know the future. How do we counteract that? We diversify. That's the key here.

>> So, how about the market booms like the AI stocks, the cryptos, , gold, and that happens everywhere? But, and I think that the riding the wave can work sometimes, but under what condition does it make sense? If you want to do it, I always say my joke is sin a little, which means just like if you're gonna do something like this, just do it a little bit. Take one take a few percent of your portfolio and put into something like but I don't want you to go from betting taking your portfolio, which is nice and diversified, and then moving selling everything and putting it all into one thing. I mean, if it works, it can you can get incredibly wealthy doing that, but for a lot of people, it doesn't work. And so, you can lose everything. So, those are kind of the trade-offs there, and those are the risks you're taking. I recommend, okay, if you feel like something's going to be a winner, just give it a slight little allocation, slight more boost. If it's 5% in your portfolio, make it 6%, make it 7%. Do something small so if it does well, you're going to feel like a winner. And if it doesn't go your way, then you don't feel that bad because you didn't lose as much in the end. So that's my way of doing that. But you need to come up with a portfolio that is diversified. I think that's the important thing because, you know, diversification is how you retain your wealth over time and how you grow your purchasing power.

>> Yeah, strongly agree. Okay. Thank you. And I think that the spending also is a very important part of asset building as well. So in just keep buying you introduced the idea of spending money guilt-free through the 2x rule. I think that was a very memorable way and a good way of balancing to balance spending and investing. So after writing the wealth ladder do you think this rule holds up when it comes to how you should spend money? The rule is once again as I said earlier there's a lot of different rules I put out there and 2x rule is one hey I want this one particular thing so if I'm going to you know spend let's you know a few thousand yen on some piece of jewelry I need to put a few thousand yen into something else right you can think of it as like okay one for one or something like that right and I say the same thing in this case of like okay that's one way of looking at it in the wealth ladder I propose the 01% rule which is one 10,000th of your wealth take your wealth, divide by 10,000, and that's how much you can spend on a daily basis and not worry about it. That's what I call a trivial or a

>> an unimportant amount. It's a very small amount of money, right? And so I'd say, hey, oh, if it's below 110,000th of my wealth, I can spend it without thinking about it. So that's another framework. If you don't like that one, try the 2x rule. If you don't like the 2x rule, like there's I'm just trying to put things out there that help people. Some people really like the 2x rule. Some people really like the 01% rule. And the 01% rule is based on your wealth. The 2x rule is based on just your behavior really like, oh, I want this thing. Okay, then I need to save double. Then I really need to go above and beyond. But there are different types of rules for different things. And so when you choose to use one or another, it's it really depends, right? I think a lot of people the 2x rule is more for like a splurge and you go above and beyond. The 01% rule is more for like daily spending. When I'm at the grocery store, do I want to get the nicer thing that costs a little bit more? And right. So that difference in price, that little marginal amount, is that below let's say 01% of my wealth. If so, I buy it. If not, maybe I don't. And so that's the thinking there.

>> On the chapter that you mentioned, does I think that this is the ultimate question. So does money buy happiness? And this really stood out to me. could you brief briefly share why you choose this title in the chapter?

>> I think it's a question that a lot of people ask and I know that's definitely true in the United States where we're obviously a little bit more money obsessed than many other cultures but the question is like does money buy happiness? And let's we looked at I looked at the studies on this and I said okay ultimately like what does all the research find the research has kind of evolved in the last few years

>> and ultimately if I had to summarize the research on money and happiness if you're already happy more money will bring more happiness. Right.

>> Right.

>> If you're poor if you don't have a lot of money more money typically brings more happiness. Okay.

>> But if you're not poor and you're not happy more money is not going to do a thing. Right? And so think about what that means because what it says most people that okay if you don't have anything you know having some sort of wealth or some security that's going to bring happiness. So we know that like that's I don't think anyone is debating that point right it's having some money is better than nothing. I'm not saying you need to be super rich but you want to have some resources so you can feed yourself clothe yourself you know have shelter all these basics. Everyone agrees on that. We can even put that aside right. What the data is really showing is that if you're already a happy person, you love life, everything's going well, more money is going to make you even happier. That's the good part. That's the good news.

>> The problem I think shows up is for those people that aren't happy, they're not poor, they don't it's not like they're in poverty or anything. They're not happy and they think money is the solution. And what I what the research shows is no, it's not. So if you're searching, if you're not poor and you're searching for money as the solution to your problems, it's not the solution and you need to focus on something else because that's going to actually make you happy. And then once you're happy, then you can go get more money because that'll make you even happier, right? So it's very ironic that the people who are already happy, more money is going to make them happier, but the people who aren't happy, money is not the solution.

>> So that brings to the point to the five elements of the greater enhancer, I guess. Yeah, I like that. I really like that part as well, especially the quote you mentioned that negative relationships are like the flu and that really stood out to me. So could you share a bit about this idea and how it fits to the great enhancer?

>> Yeah. So the idea of the great enhancer is like you know money is this thing that can that enhances everything else in your life. By itself it's not that useful. And the analogy I use is salt, right? Salt can make a dish taste much better. But you would never just eat pure salt, right? Salt by itself is not that appetizing. And my argument or my analogy is money just by itself without family, without friends, without health, without time, like

>> is not useful, right? Just having a bunch of money, but you don't have your health or you don't have friends, you don't have family, it would be a terrible life. So, you kind of need it alto together. And money is kind of like the salt of your life, right? That's how I envision it in the analogy, right? And so what you just talked about is like okay let's go through the other types of wealth like how does you know social wealth impact your life your happiness how you feel how does physical you know wealth which is like you can think of as your health in many ways your mental wealth you know all the time wealth how much time free time do you have how much time do you have to do things you care about all these types of things impact your life and money can can help with those but by itself money is not going to provide anything you know to your life besides just some basic level of security. Right? After that, then you need those other things to make your life actually worthwhile.

>> What does wealth actually mean to you? Not just reaching the top of the ladder, but improving the life itself.

>> The idea is wealth should allow you to build the life that you want and that you desire, right? So, it's like it's really living life on your own terms, right? Of course, it's a very that's a very vague definition, but for every person, it's going to be different. For some people, they're not going to feel wealthy until they literally have enough resources to retire and never work again. Some people aren't going to feel wealthy unless they have enough resources so they can spend their time how they want. Let's let's say their friends and family. Some people won't feel wealthy unless they have the money so they can, you know, go and invest in their health and maybe join a gym and do all these things. Like, everyone's different, right? And so figuring out what that thing is for you, that's what I how I define wealth. It's living life on your own terms. There's a lot of people that can live life on their own terms. That doesn't mean you have to be financially free. Like you can say, "Hey, my terms are I'm going to have this job. I'm going to go to work. I'm going to do this stuff, but on the weekends, I get to go and do this other thing that I really like, and it doesn't pay me anything, but I just really enjoy it." And for me, that is wealth. Having the ability to go and do stuff you care about is wealth. And so, a lot of people have more wealth than they think. And I I like to emphasize that in the book and and really have you think more holistically and as I said bigger picture about all this stuff.

>> So it's not just about money but you know you have to have your own perspective to take a look at the wealth that's that you don't even notice.

>> Exactly. And so I think that's a lot of thing we it's easy to overlook. I mean and I think the reason for this is it's measurement right. It's very easy to measure like and see a precise number for oh here's my net worth here's my bank account balance here's my saving account or checking account balance here's what's in my niece account like you can everyone has numbers very easy you can't say oh here's my friend account bal you don't have that right you can maybe count how many friends you have but even then like one really good friend is more important than a hundred just kind of acquaintances right so I think there's a lot of ways in which us looking at me just how we measure things impacts how we think about wealth and so it's something to kind of keep in mind so I push back a little bit and say hey think about wealth a little bit bigger picture because that's what's going to allow you to live your life on your own terms

>> could you share a final message to your Japanese fans please I mean I noticed in the Japanese edition of your book there's a special or original introduction for the Japanese readers right so if you could any if you could share any stories is behind that. Any message to the fans, please?

>> So, when I when I visited Japan, this was November 2024, so about a year ago.

>> , I noticed, and obviously, this is something that most tourists will notice, like there's a lot of rules in Japan, and the rules aren't written down. I didn't, it's not like when I landed, someone handed me, "Oh, by the way, when you're on the escalator in Tokyo, be on the left side, but when you're in Osaka, be on the right side." Like, no one tells you this, right? But it's very interesting how quick and easy it is to pick up on these rules and you pick up on the norms because everyone follows them and there's no police out there saying you need to follow the rules. People just enforce it themselves which is very nice and so you start to understand a little bit more about a society and rules are very useful in that sense. And I didn't realize this but I wrote the just keep buying rules and I had these like rules for finance. I'm like

>> I just wrote that because I thought it would be useful. I didn't realize that, you know, Japan has a lot of these little informal rules and that probably spoke to a lot of people like, oh, these are interesting. I can just follow rules because rules are like a part of this culture in many ways. And so, while I was there, it was very interesting for me to kind of see that and see the rules. And when I was writing this book, I was thinking about, okay, the rules are just the baseline. That's the first way. And that's it's a very strict thing, which is kind of what I did with just keep buying. I kind of gave a very strict here's what you do in all these situations. But with the wealth ladder, as I said, I zoom out. I look at the bigger picture and I say, "Okay, how can we adapt these rules based on where you are in your financial life? Are you level one? Are you level two, etc." And so that was a kind of a new concept I was messing with. And I did try to include more Japanese references in the book because I'm like, "Hey, I didn't realize I had an audience here." And so I'm now I feel, you know, obligated to write for this audience and talk about some of their things. Obviously, I can't write everything about it cuz I don't fully understand the culture. I didn't grow up there. I've spent only a few days there. But I've been, you know, it's been very fun to kind of learn what I have learned. And so when I was writing all this stuff, I was trying to say, okay, what how might a Japanese reader think about this particular story or this thing, right? Even as I'm kind of going through and just thinking about these things, which is very useful. But yeah, so I mean my the message to the Japanese, you know, readers is thank you for reading, I would say. And just I truly appreciate everything and, you know, it's been just a pleasant surprise from my end. And I plan to do I mean I'm slowly kind of getting the ball rolling but I plan to do more content in Japan. I plan to do more types of stuff out there eventually and it's going to take me time but I really want to do as much as I can to to learn more about Japan, learn more about these types of financial issues. I actually funny enough

>> I did a virtual talk which was shown at a conference in Japan. I think it just it was maybe last month and I had to do this whole analysis on the Nissan and like how does the Nissa account work and if you maxed it out like the new Nissa versus the old Nissa and like walking through all those things and so I know a little bit about this stuff but I am you know very interested to talk more about it in the future. So I've just been very I'm mostly grateful. It's just been everyone's been super nice and I love I love Japan and everything's done for me. So thank you so much.

>> very excited to hear that. Thank you so much again and I hope that many of the Japanese readers will become your fan by reading the wealth ladder as well. So thank you very much Nick and I hope to see you again hopefully in Tokyo or any parts of Japan next time.

>> Of course. Of course.

>> Of course. Yeah, I will definitely reach out to you guys and hopefully we can maybe do media in the future. I think that would be very fun.

>> Sure. Sure. Thank you so much. So see you soon. Yes. Thank you. Fore just to keep buying. Fore! Foreign! Foreign! Heat. Heat.
