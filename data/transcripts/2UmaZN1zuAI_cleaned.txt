If you have the blessing of having some money to pass on, you want to give your kids enough money so they can do anything, but not enough money so they can do nothing. That's a Warren Buffett quote. If my kid is not doing a whole lot of anything but partying, and I keep seeing on his Instagram he's on in a beether or something, I'm not going to give him dick. It's like, okay, boss, if you have enough time to just party all the time, you don't need my money. [music] In today's office hours, we discuss the future of PropG's AI tools, my day-to-day routine, and the right way to pass money on to your kids. Question number one. Our first question comes from Pygmy Nuthatch on Reddit. Pygmy Nuthatch, where do they get these names? They say, "I'd like to ask some questions about your Google persona. What were the original goals of the project? Do you have any future plans for PropG AI offerings? the tool or something similar could do a lot of good though we all understand and respect the reasons you gave for ultimately deciding not to move forward with an expanded launch. Thanks. So just some background here I have students and then the best students I ask to meet my graduate student instructors. I usually have four or five because I usually have about 180 students and I say you're running the class. I'm just the talent. One of my graduate student instructors went on to be go to work for Google about seven eight years ago. She's been very successful there and she contacted me about a year ago. crawl everyone's a person's information and create a character AI for them such that people can ask them questions and they were doing some in the health space some in the business space and then some of the academic space and they asked me if I'd be interested and I said sure and there was no commercial agreement no money involved but the impetus and the motivation was the following I get between 20 and 30 that's conservative outreaches a day from single mothers from young men people in the mental health profession from high school teachers looking for help, advice, insight, basic questions. Where did you find this piece of information? Here's an idea. And I can't get to 1% of them. So, I thought, how could I come up with something that would say, "Hey, here's my character AI. Ask it the same question, and there's an 80% probability it'll get it 80% right." And so, we started working on this thing about a year ago. And then in that time, things changed dramatically. And that is character AIS became a thing. And it was discovered that a lot of young people minors were engaging these character AIs and starting to develop these not even parasocial relationships but in-depth relationships that often times led to very dark places. And so when it came out it was launched I went on it and I just was so uncomfortable with the idea of contributing to the sequestration of young men from their parents, their mentors and their friends. And I thought if I'm in any way giving a young man an excuse to spend less time pursuing offline relationships then that is bad and I don't want to engage in it. So it was up for about 4 hours and the Twitter philosopher I think his name's Naval, he said something that struck me. He's actually I think a venture capitalist but I think of him as a philosopher. He said that if you're having trouble making a decision the answer is usually no. And I was just so uncertain and uneasy about this thing. thing. It had only been up 4 hours and I felt bad because the good people at Google and they were good people. I think the world of this woman and my interaction with the this team at Google had been nothing but positive and I didn't they had spent so much time on it and I just finally I said I'm just not [ __ ] comfortable with this thing. And I called them and said, "Can you take it down? I just don't want to be part of the character AI dilemma right now until I we figure out what the guard rails are and how to handle it." And so they took it down. is there potential upside? Yeah. But the potential downside I think is unknown right now. Started out as a good idea. I think my intentions were good or in the right place, but [music] I was increasingly uncomfortable with the development and evolution of character AIS and decided to pull it down. Support for the show comes from Grunes. The new year always comes with resolutions, and that can be a lot of pressure to improve yourself. That's all well and good, but what's the point of doing all that if you can't stick with it long term? Gruns proves you can do the least and still feel the most thanks to a delicious daily habit that does the heavy lifting. If you haven't heard me talk about Gruns before, they're a convenient, comprehensive formula packed into a snack pack of gummies a day. This isn't a multivitamin, a greens gummy, or a prebiotic. [music] It's all of those things and then some at a fraction of the price. And bonus, it tastes great. Grun's ingredients are backed by over 35,000 research publications, and it comes in packs because you can't fit the amount of nutrients Gruns does into a single gummy, like six g of prebiotic fiber. That's like eating two cups of broccoli, [music] but in one tasty little snack pack. Kick your new year off right and save up to 52% off with code propguns.co. [music] That's code propg.co. Question number two also comes from Reddit. Radical Buy asks, "Scott, what is your daily routine when you're not [music] out on a book tour? Would love to see how the big dog spends his time." Well, I usually get up at about 4:45. I do a cold plunge and then I take I have a massive protein shank including all sorts of grains and sheep oil and also this serum that's mined from algae off the coast of Sri Lanka. None of this is true. None of this is true. All right, let's start with at night. I'm usually doing something out with friends or with family or watching streaming media. The family goes to bed. Sometimes I used to have a drink. Now I don't do that anymore cuz this anti-alcohol movement has even me a bit freaked out. My 50-year-old liver 60 can't handle 61 can't handle alcohol the way my 30-year-old liver could. So I don't I don't want to. And also I think drinking alone is probably not a good idea. But I try and unwind at night. I watch streaming media. I let the dogs up on the couch with me. I like to write. I like to cruise the internet. Sometimes I take an edible. And I'm up to 2 or 3:00 a.m. in the morning. I'm a night person. That's where I get my best thinking done. They say that people who get up early in the morning are more productive. And people who stay up late are more creative. I'd like to think I'm creative. I can definitely confirm I'm not that productive. So, I'm up till 2 or 3 in the morning. I usually get up around 10:00. If I want to sleep in, I'll sleep until 10:30. My assistant doesn't book anything before noon, which helps cuz I'm in London, so it's 7:00 a.m. where my team is back in New York. And then I get up. I have my quick hit of coffee. I try to have a breakfast. I try to work out. I have free weights and a rowing machine and this new thing called an amp, which is basically a tonal. So, I try and get in some exercise. And then I basically start the day of podcasting. And between writing and podcasting and team meetings and editorial calls and interviews with media, I'm kind of going from about 11 or noon until about 8 or 9:00 p.m. at which point I kick off. sometimes go out to dinner. I go out a lot. Sometimes go out and meet friends, do something with family, and then everyone's in bed by call 11, 11:30, and I'm up for another two and a half hours kind of doing my work, so to speak. So, I keep very odd hours. I'm struggling a little bit lately with I don't want to call it anxiety, but just more fear, if you will. Is that anxiety? Maybe it's anxiety. I need to get outside more. Probably the only thing I really don't like about London, but it makes me in many ways, it's just kind of a deal killer for me. I can't handle the [ __ ] weather here. It's dark at 400 p.m. right now, so I don't go outside as much as I should, which is a really bad thing. All the things I preach to people about. It's like the coppish kids have no shoes. But anyways, mornings are basically kind of free time or sleep, 11 to 8, podcasting, 8 to 11, socialization, 11 to 2, that's my time, I guess. And then I hit But I go to sleep very late. I keep very odd hours. I By the way, I would not recommend this to anybody. I don't I don't I'm not saying it's the right way. It's just my way. We'll be right back after a quick break. [music] Support for the show comes from Quint. People love to say new year, new me. And honestly, that sounds like a lot. No need to start from scratch, I say.

From soft Mongolian Kashmir sweaters that feel like designer pieces without the markup to 100% silk tops and skirts for easy dressing up to perfectly cut denim for everyday wear.

Hey Scott, Charles from [music] Texas. Hi Charles. I want your take on my inheritance strategy for my son. Instead of giving him a pile of money when he's 70, when he'll just spend it on knee injections, a firmer mattress, or some dick pills, I want to give him cash when it actually matters. plan is 25K at 18 so he doesn't start adulthood broke. 100K at 30 so he can buy a house or start a business. And then 1 million at 40. After that, the gravy train stops. Dad retires from being the bank. What pitfalls should I watch for? And feel free to tell me if this whole plan is genius or just financial cosplay. So Fed data shows that US inheritance recipients had a median age of around 49 to 50 at the time they received wealth transfers. And according to the Richmond Fed, at least half of people don't receive their first inheritance until after age 40. I would bet that's going to go up because people are living longer and what people actually spend on. Younger groups tend to spend a larger share on categories including shelter, food away from home, transportation and education and overall consumer spending data confirms necessities dominate budgets when they're younger. Which is why a lump sum for housing down payment or business seed capital can be more financially productive than inheriting money late for discretionary spending. So I don't think anyone's figured this out. I always go to I'm thinking about the same thing. I always go to a couple things. One, you want to give your if you have the blessing of having some money to pass on, you want to give your kids enough money so they can do anything, but not enough money so they can do nothing. That's a Warren Buffett quote. My approach is going to be, I learned this from Morgan Hel. I'm going to scale up or scale down my kids' efforts. And that is I'm not sure I'm going to lock into and I don't think there is a reason to create a suicide pack or something you have to stick to because I think a lot of it depends on the kid. Now, what do I mean? So, if my kid gets out of college at 22 and wants to be in nonprofit, I'm going to give him money. If he's a productive citizen and works hard and is in a lowpaying industry, if he wants to be a high school math teacher, I'm going to give him money. If my kid is not doing a whole lot of anything but partying and I keep seeing on his Instagram, he's on in a beether or something. By the way, I don't have that problem. My boys are 15 and 18 right now. I'm not going to give them dick. It's like, okay, boss, if you have enough time to just party all the time, you don't need my money. When I pass away, that's a whole other thing. I'll probably limit the distribution while they're under the age of 40. Or maybe you put parameters around it. They can use the money for education or a house, a primary residence, but for nothing else. I think about this a lot and I still haven't figured out what to do. The only push back I would give is I would not lock yourself in anything. If your kid's a great kid and wants to buy a house and is having a kid, you may want to pull some of that million dollars at 40 forward. But at the same time, if they're just living in your basement and not motivated, I don't think you want to give them any money. But again, I think this is a personal question. It's kind of up to you. I have friends who are wealthy and cut off their kids after college. Just like, that's it. You're done. You're out. And it's my money, not your money. I'm rich, you're not rich. And then I have other friends whose kids have never flown commercially. Even when they're adults, they pay for their private air travel. So I would argue the former is probably much better than the latter. I think it's a personal decision. And anyways, long-winded way of saying I don't know. My only advice is not to lock yourself into a construct. That's all for this episode. If you'd like to submit a question, please email a voice recording to office hours.com.
