Ed Elson speaks with Maurice Obstfeld, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, about the economic situation in Iran and what Trump’s new tariff on its business partners means for the country. Then Mark Zandi, Chief Economist at Moody’s Analytics, joins the show to discuss inflation data from December and why the numbers are not exactly accurate.
