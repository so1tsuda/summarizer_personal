I've spent time in more than 150 countries, and only one of those I keep coming back to. The country that I've returned to the most as a traveler is the land of the rising sun, Japan. But just because you love a country to bits doesn't mean it's a good investment. Today, I'm going to tell you why you absolutely should have Japanese exposure in your portfolio. We'll look at the best ways to get exposure and talk about some Japanese stocks, even five Japanese stocks that Warren Buffett has invested in. Everything you need to know about investing in Japan is in this presentation, so watch it closely, please. You'll learn a ton. I promise. So many American investors only have exposure to US stocks. That's called domestic bias and it results in investors not being exposed to a good chunk of global equities, including Japan. So where can we find a list of all global stocks to start with? We can turn to the leader in global indices MSCI. Now I started working at MSCI while they were still part of Morgan Stanley, and I left the firm probably nine years after their IPO. During that time, I learned a lot about how these indices work. And I think every retail investor should have a good understanding of how to carve up the global universe of all stocks in the world. And one such universe is the MSCI ACWI IMI Index. Now, ACWI stands for All Country World Index. So, all countries in the world. And IMI simply means all market caps. And basically, this index can be cut into two pieces. You have developed markets and emerging markets. And MSCI is a very sophisticated methodology that looks at how to assign a country into an emerging market or a developed market classification. And as you can see here, this index is composed of 23 developed markets, 24 emerging markets. And when you combine those both, you get 8,286 stocks. That represents 99% of the global equity investment opportunity. Now, just some key points from Grok here. There is zero overlap between developed and emerging markets. So, a country has to be classified in one or the other. And when you break these down, developed market countries, so the more mature countries in the world, make up about 88 to 90% of the weight of this index, whilst emerging markets make up the rest. So, they're a very small component of total global equities. And here you can see a summary of that index. So again, 8,286 stocks, the top 10 constituents on the right, the usual suspects there, NVIDIA floating at the top, followed by Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. Now, when we take that index and start breaking it down by country, it gets very interesting. So the largest country, the biggest chunk of global stocks, intuitively, is the United States at around 64% of global equities. What that means is that 36% of your equities exposure should be global. And the second largest market in the world after the United States is Japan. Around 5.5% of your equity exposure should be in Japanese stocks. And nearly 80% of your global equity exposure would be in the five countries that you see here. US, Japan, United Kingdom, China, and Canada. Now this is very important to note. It's not a matter of whether Japan is a good investment or not, and we're going to talk a little bit about that. It's a matter of having exposure to global equities in appropriate weightings. So, anyone who has equity exposure ought to have global equity exposure. And of that, 5% ought to be exposure to Japan. Some of you may want to actively manage your Japan exposure either through using an ETF or perhaps by having a small portfolio of stocks. The purpose of that would then be so that you could either overweight or underweight Japan. And I had Super Grok pull up an overweight and underweight thesis. So on the bullish side, there's reforms happening that include stock buybacks and increased dividend payouts. So upping the value component there. There's also a valuation discount here to be considered. So I think the Japanese stocks are around 12 times forward earnings. US stocks probably double that. And after decades of stagflation, inflation has returned. So the economy might be turning itself around. On the other hand, Japan's government debt exceeds 250% of their GDP. That could potentially be problematic. The Yen weakness, this is remarkable. So exposure to the Yen by investing directly in Japanese stocks has cost investors up to 30% in purchasing power over 5 years. So, I'm here in Japan now and I just went and bought a pair of my favorite jeans from Momotaro, and they're the cheapest I've ever bought them. Right now, the yen is very weak, and it's a great time to visit Japan. Well, anytime is a great time to visit Japan, frankly. But there's also an aging population and low birth rates which potentially pose problems. So, you can make a bull case or a bear case for Japan. And after you do, you'll probably find that your investments there behave entirely opposite of what your thesis proposed. So having a thesis around Japan isn't the focus here. It's really having Japanese exposure because it's the second largest economy in the world. And when we look at what ETFs might give us that exposure, you have, of course, iShares MSCI Japan ETF. And that charges too much. They charge 50 basis points. And even though it's the largest ETF out there, it's certainly one I wouldn't invest in because multiple studies have found that, intuitively, low expense ratios are the biggest predictor of fund outperformance. So back in the day, I was looking at country ETFs and I saw Japan, and it was trading at $15 a share, and I was like, "Wow, it's so cheap." So I'm so glad I eventually learned that the price of an asset has nothing to do with the value. So just because this trades at $80 a share doesn't mean anything at all. Literally, it means nothing. What you need to pay attention to are expense ratios. Now, what we can do then is go to VettaFi and pull up a list of all Japanese ETFs, and I've done that here. You can see iShares actually has one currency hedge. So, I wonder why they did that, right? So, you could hedge away that exposure to yen. But when we go down this list, I think anything above this red line is fair game in terms of size. You always want to invest in ETFs that have a reasonable amount of assets under management. And we can then flip the page here and look at expense ratios. And clearly one stands out. It's Franklin FTSE Japan ETF. So that's the one that I would invest in because it has the lowest expense ratio. And we can start to dig into that. Honestly, in looking across these ETFs, in particular, the iShares and this Franklin ETF, there's not a whole lot of difference in terms of constituents, but you'll find pictures like this. So Industrials are quite high, around 24% of your exposure. than consumer discretionary. Information Technology in fourth place there. Contrast that to the US where Information Technology is dominant. Then, when we start looking at holdings, Toyota, of course, is on the top there. Always buy a used Toyota. It's one of the best financial decisions you ever make. Start going down, and I wanted to highlight, I mean, there's some familiar names here but wanted to highlight a few: Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Mitsui. So these are what's called Sogo shosha, and they're general trading companies. They're more or less conglomerates, but it's a lot more complicated than that. And there's seven major houses. I've circled the top five here. And the reason I've done that is because these happen to be firms that Warren Buffett is holding. So he first started investing in these companies, I think, it was in 2019. His ownership of these has increased from roughly 8.5% to almost 10% across these five firms. He says he wants to hold these for decades, potentially forever. So, if Warren Buffett vetted the Japanese investment thesis and found these compelling, then that certainly says something, right? So, speaking of foreign stocks, we recently sent out a survey to our paying customers, and one of the most frequent requests, I was quite surprised, was for far more foreign stock coverage. That's not just because half of our paying customers are from abroad. It's also because US investors are increasingly becoming interested in foreign stocks. Now, I couldn't be more excited to do that, given how much I love travel and foreign cultures. Can you say, more exciting work trips coming up? However, in the past, we haven't seen a lot of interest in our foreign stock content. So, if you want to see more foreign stock coverage, please like this video, hype it. There's this new hype feature on YouTube now. You can avail yourselves of that, please. And share this video with your friends. And in return, I'll plan on doing more of this type of content going forward because it's what our bosses want. Maybe a piece on Japanese tech stocks, right? So, let me know in the comment section what you think about that. So, let's touch on Japanese tech stocks for a second. I saw this question raised recently. Is innovation in Japan all just a big sticktick? I can tell you that nobody innovates like the Japanese when it comes to a household. It's insane how well they've figured out innovation. But the counterpoint would be, well, that's all just a ruse and that proper innovation is quite stale. That would merit a further look, I think. Now, if you want to start investing in Japanese stocks, well, you're in for a real treat. And when I worked for MSCI, I always needed to staff. So, I was in the Hong Kong office, I always needed to staff a Chinese person that could speak Japanese. And then when we started porting over some of our operations to Manila, we specifically hired Japanese speakers there, which were tough to find. And we had to keep them on staff because it was impossible for us to navigate the world of Japanese stocks without having native speakers. This isn't just about, you know, converting yen to USD or figuring out how to navigate some of the most shoddiest investment collateral mankind has ever seen. The biggest problem is that you can't Google translate your way through it at all. This blog had popped up, Engrish.com. It's a collection of all the different things the Japanese say that are quite comical and endearing. They try to literally translate English a lot of times and it's just a complete and total mess. Some of my more favorite ones, they used to rank them at this site. One is a Japanese gentleman with a Christmas shirt that says "crap your hands." Right? Supposed to be clap your hands, but of course, they pronounce the L, R. And then perhaps one of my favorites is, if you spend a lot of time in Asia, you're familiar with bubble tea. It's this tea, and it's got these tapioca balls inside of it. So there's this sign presumably at a coffee shop and it has a little picture of the bubble tea and it's little eyes there and it says, "Hi, I'm bubble tea." And then below it, it shows the little balls floating in the cup, and then it says, "Suck my balls." Right? So they don't know what that means, right? It's all kinds of fun, and it just points to how difficult it is to understand the Japanese culture, what the Japanese are saying, and Japanese companies in general. Now, if you're going to start investing there, you'll need access to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It's the largest Exchange, Japan, covers over 3,900 listed companies. They break for lunch, which is all rather endearing. And they go eat Japanese food, what they call food. And let me tell you that the food in Japan is insane. Anthony Bourdain said it was probably one of the greatest culinary manifestations on this planet. Indeed, it is. He called it a densely packed, impenetrable layer cake. You wouldn't believe it. Anyways, after you eat some amazing food, you can buy some stocks, and those need to be bought in round lots. And what that can mean is that you can only buy a 100 shares of something and that's it. They sell them in 100 share lots. If you don't have the money, you don't get to buy the stock. So, that can be problematic for retail investors that don't have a big enough bankroll. Also, be aware of exchange fees. I mean, we use Interactive Brokers to trade stocks in Japan, and just about every other Exchange on this planet. They work very well for that purpose, but you're going to be probably charged some Exchange fees, so pay attention to that. And then there's the yen situation. That's almost attractive at this point. I mean, you would hope the yen wouldn't sink any further than it already has. I certainly enjoy that, but I think that might be a risk worth taking, in terms of hoping that it rebounds. If it doesn't, then you ought to get yourself over here and start spending some of your currency against the yen because it's a great place to visit. So, just some closing comments. Japan is the largest market to invest in, next to the USA. Everyone should have some Japanese exposure, along with exposure to other countries per the reasons that we gave today. Regional coverage is really just that sufficient and many of you already have it through your 401k funds and such. Or you could always ape Warren Buffett's approach or perhaps establish your own little portfolio of Japanese stocks. But prepare to be underwhelmed in general. That seems to be the way it is when it comes to investing in foreign stocks, many times, because they just enjoy a valuation discount to the US, and that's just how it's always been and will be. And remember that researching and following Japanese companies over time is very tough. Overall, your foreign stock exposure should be roughly 34%. So, we're going to look to cover other major countries going forward. Now, you may have noticed earlier that China had a very low weighting than intuitively it should, if you're going to use GDP weighting should actually be weighted much higher. So, we did a piece looking at just at that earlier this year when I was in Hangzhou. We did a number of pieces on Chinese stocks. I've put one up here next that proposes perhaps now is a good time to invest in China. Give that a watch next. Thanks so much for taking the time to watch this today.
