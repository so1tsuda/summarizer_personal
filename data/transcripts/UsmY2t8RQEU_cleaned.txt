All right, hello and welcome back to the Broken Business Models podcast. We are your hosts, Ryan and James. And before we get into today's podcast, just a quick disclaimer, nothing that we say in this podcast or any of our other material should be taken as investment advice. James and I could have positions in any stock we may mention today, and we reserve the right to change those positions at any time. So, make sure to always do your own work and consult with a professional before making any investment decision. With that being said, today we're going to talk about EOS Energy. So, we've talked about EOS many times before on this podcast, but just for a quick background, EOS Energy is a company whose business model is to create rechargeable battery cells that are zinc based. They use a zinc based chemistry as opposed to traditional lithium- based rechargeable batteries. So, the point of zinc, this zinc based chemistry is that it is much less efficient in terms of storage like how much energy it can store for the weight. You know, these battery cells are much more heavy than lithium batteries, but they're theoretically up to 30% more cost effective per unit of energy stored than lithium batteries. So, while they would not make a good product for anything that anything where the weight is a concern, their main target customer is their target application is things like grids scale energy storage. So if you think about renewable energy where wind turbines or solar panels are only producing energy a certain time of the day during those times they could be charging these theoretically cheap energy cells and then when the wind is not blowing or when the sun is not shining these zinc based batteries can produce the electricity in the meantime. So that's the idea with these zinc based batteries. In terms of the financials, unfortunately for EOS Energy, the financial situation is pretty desperate. So since they went public in this during the spa mania of 2020, they've they've constantly been generating very large operating losses. Their revenue has been basically immaterial until the most recent few quarters. And even in the most recent few quarters, it's not nearly enough to cover their cost of goods sold. So they're run rating about you know they're losing hundreds of millions of dollars per year in terms of operating losses and that those losses are accelerating and they've since their spa they've they've had to raise many rounds of diluted funding to fund those losses. So in the most recent quarter they did generate record revenue of $30 million. In the past few quarters they've been generating more revenue than they ever have in the past. But as I had mentioned before, they're still burning on the order of about $250 million per year on that revenue. , operationally, they've had some they've had numerous supply chain issues that have only recently started being resolved. , and the most the most fundamental challenge that they are facing is that the competitive landscape is be is has been very difficult especially in the past two three years. So in 2020 as you can see from this chart in the bottom right I have the prices of lithium carbonate which is a raw input into creating lithium based batteries. So in 2020 the prices of lithium skyrocketed during the EV boom but since then new supplies come online very rapidly and since about 2024 and 2025 the price of lithium has gone down to the pre-EV hype lows. So traditional lithium based batteries have become much cheaper which kind of destroys the whole cost effective narrative of the zinc based batteries that EOS produce produces. So that's the situation that EOS Energy is in today. Like I like I mentioned before in the most recent quarters they've started generating significantly more revenue than they have in the past. You know still much less than they need to cover their cost of goods sold. But along with that, management has also been guiding for revenue to continue increasing into 2026 and they talk about having a massive order backlog and that has caused the stock price to increase massively since the end of 2024. However, there are questions about the order backlog and the trajectory of their future revenue. recently a well-known short seller called Fuzzy Panda Research put out a short report on EOS Energy talking a lot about this order backlog and so there are many questions about that about that and to get into those I will kick it over to you James.

>> Yes thank you. So on October 30th, Fuzzy Panda Research published a short report with a lot of allegations against EOS Energy. And in for the remainder of the video, we'll basically be going through the main points of the main points from the fuzzy panda report. And just also a quick note, we have a website called differentiatedanalytics.com. There's a link to it in the description of the video below. But on the website, we have a free section. , under the shortselling research section, we have a short report aggregator. And what we do is we follow a number of activist short sellers. And whenever they whenever they publish a new short report, we will summarize it into a single paragraph, making it, you know, much easier to read and understand. And then we'll also have include a link to the full report if you want to read the full report. So this is you know if you want to keep track of the latest activist short seller reports go to our website differentiatedanalytics.com. We also have our own premium original research but you can access the short report aggregator for free. And back in October when Fuzzy Panda released the released the short report about EOSE, we in we included a summary of it on our short report aggregator section. So yeah, you check that out if that at all sounds interesting to you. And now let's get back to this Fuzzy Panda report. So there are a few main issues a few main big allegations that Fuzzy Panda has made in the report. The first allegation is that EOS's zinc based batteries, apparently the chemistry of them is very dangerous. And there have allegedly been multiple incidences of the batteries releasing hydrogen broomemide gas, which is a potentially deadly gas. and Fuzzy Panda sent a FOYA Freedom of Information Act request to the local fire department. The fire the fire department had to go was called to EOS's headquarters due to a hydrogen broomemide leak. So here we do have evidence apparently from the fire department that there was a hydrogen bromide leak which is potentially very dangerous. Fuzzy Panda also claims that at multiple of of EOS's customer locations, there have been reports of hydrogen broomemide leaks. Now, this is potentially a very dangerous gas. So, that's, you know, potentially a huge problem. Now, the other big issue relates to their supposed order backlog. Now, to date, their revenue has been pretty minuscule. it has increased, their revenue has increased throughout 2025, but it's still pretty small. I think as Ryan said earlier, their revenue in the third quarter, the most recent quarter was $30 million. But EOS claims they have this massive order backlog for $644 million and that they expect to fulfill over the coming years. we have published multiple videos about EOS Energy on this channel in the past and one of the issues that we've raised in the past is that there's reason to believe that this order backlog is mostly fake where their customers in the order backlog are in a lot of cases tiny companies or companies that appear to be defunct and there's basically no way that they would actually be able to pay $644 million. Fuzzy Panda has gone even further and they claim based on their conversations with former EOS employees that EOS has three different sets of financial projections and there are certain I guess they have the real financial projections that they use internally of what they actually think the business will do over the coming years. Then they have you know fake projections that they show to investors and that they showed to the department of energy in order to secure a department of energy loan. So, a while ago, EOS received a large loan from the Department of Energy as part of I think it was as part of Biden's inflation reduction act. There's all these loans that the DOE was giving to green energy companies. And to qualify for one of the loans, you have to give the Department of Energy your financial projections and show that your you expect your business to actually be viable. and and then so that the DOE can have some confidence that you're going to be able to pay the money back. According to Fuzzy Panda, the EOS sent a misleading version of their financial projections to the Department of Energy to get the loan, even though they know internally that they're almost certainly not going to make the they're not going to meet these financial projections, probably because this order backlog, the $644 million of order backlog that they claim to have, probably doesn't really exist. And you know, we'll drill down into this order backlog even further on the next few slides. So, the order backlog includes a lot of customers that are probably not even going to be able to come up with the money to pay for the orders. And also, a lot of these so-called orders and the order backlogs are not binding orders. They are non-binding letters of intent. So, Fuzzy Panda claims to have found the actual letter of intent for one of the supposed customers, a c a company called Carson Hybrid, , Carson Hybrid Energy Storage. So, Carson Hybrid Energy Storage is one of these companies that is included in EOS's backlog. They're part of the $644 million of backlog. However, according to the letter that Fuzzy Panda found, Carson has not actually placed any binding order to EOS. All they have is a non-binding letter of intent with and a commercial contract is being contemplated. They could deploy energy storage, right? So, they might buy an EOS battery. they could buy EOS batteries and they are contemplating signing a contract of EOS, but they have not actually signed any binding contract. They So, it's pretty ridiculous for EOS to include that in their order backlog. Now, there's another company called Pinegate. there's a solar company called Pinegate. Now, Pinegate has already taken deliveries of some EOS batteries a few quarters ago. However, according to multiple Pinegate and EOS employees that talked to Fuzzy Panda, they said Pinegate was not happy with the performance of the EOS batteries that they had purchased because they had gas leaks essentially that hydrogen bro hydrogen broomemide toxic gas and the roundtrip efficiency was very bad. So only about 50%. So that means that notice this solar company Pine Gate they have the solar panels on they put in energy into the zinc battery the EOS zinc battery but then because the battery is so inefficient by the time that you extract the energy out of the battery half of it is gone. So because it's so bad, Hindgate is not going is not going to order any more batteries from EOS most likely, but they still have, you know, they are still included in the customer backlog. Not only that, according to Bloomberg, Pinegate is on the brink of filing for bankruptcy. So you're going to have this near bankrupt company that purchased a few batteries from EOS. The performance was much worse than expected. So they are not going to they're probably not going to order anymore and they're about to go bankrupt anyway. So they probably could not even order any more EOS batteries even if they wanted to. Despite that, they still represent a significant chunk of EOS's claimed backlog. And now the final issue, this actually ties back to something that we talked about in one of our previous videos. So, you know, all the way back in May, , in May of 2025, EOS fired their CFO, Eric Jvidi, without cause. And this was very, you know, very weird because they had just hired Eric Jvidi, three months prior. So, they hired him in March of 2025 and then just a few months later in May, they fired him without cause and they didn't give any reason for it. Now, at the time we published a video on this channel going over this and we said this is very suspicious and at the time we speculated that Jvidi was uncomfortable with EOS's claimed order backlog. You know, EOS has this huge order backlog that they, you know, tell they brag about to investors and they probably also tell the DOA DOE, yeah, give us this loan because we have this massive $600 million order backlog. But there are a lot of concerns where a lot of this order backlog are just non-binding letters of intent or orders from, you know, tiny or defunct companies that are not even going to be able to pay. So, we thought maybe Eric Jvidi, he got into his role as the CFO. He looked at this order backlog and said, "Hey, I'm not comfortable with this. , I don't want to play ball with, you know, touting this fake order backlog." And then because he wasn't willing to pay play ball with this charade, that's probably why he was fired. That's what we speculated at the time. Well, , Joe Mstrangelo, the CEO of EOS, he apparently has a weak moral compass and he is basically running, you know, this fraud where he's claiming to have this huge order backlog. Any of his other executives at EOS who question the backlog or aren't willing to go along with the fraud, they risk being fired. And that's why we see extremely high turnover rate in EOS's seuite. Over the past five years, EOS has had four CFOs and three chief commercial officers, which is an extremely high, extremely unusual rate of se executive turnover. And of course, the most recent and shocking example was Eric Chvidi, who was fired after just three months. So overall, this fuzzy panda report really corroborates a lot of the concerns that we have raised about EOS over the past year. I think this is the fourth video that we're making about EOS. And while the stock price has like increased throughout 2025 because there's like a lot of hype about, you know, them finally starting to generate revenue and a lot of bullish projections that the company has given. We think that, you know, this is basically a house of cars that will soon collapse because there are so many quality issues with the batteries and the order backlog is probably fake. So, I think they're probably going to miss revenue expectations for 2026. And then, of course, there's the longer term issue with because the lithium price has declined so much, , it's really unclear that zinc batteries are even a viable technology at all. So, that about wraps it up for everything we have to talk about EOS today. As always, if you have any opinions or thoughts about the company, please let us know in the comments section below. And we will see you all on next week's video.
