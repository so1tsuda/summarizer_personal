All right, hello and welcome back to the Broken Business Models podcast. We're your hosts, Ryan and James. And before we get into today's podcast, just a quick disclaimer. Nothing in this podcast or any of our other materials should be taken as investment advice. James and I could have positions in any of the stocks we may mention today, and we reserve the right to change those positions at any time. So, always make sure to do your own work and consult with a professional before making any investment decision. With that being said, the topic of today's podcast is a small startup called Aptterra. So, Apttera is an electric vehicle startup with a little bit of a unique twist to it. So instead of making regular EVs in the sense of you know regular cars that are just powered by electricity instead of regular gasoline they make a very small two seat two-door tricycle powered by electricity where the entire aim is to make it as small and as light and as efficient as possible. So it's made out of lightweight materials like carbon fiber made to be very aerodynamic and it also has solar panels mounted throughout its body and on the roof. And the idea is that these solar panels will generate enough electricity that and the car is so efficient that the electricity that the solar panels are able to generate will be enough to give you more than 40 miles of driving range based completely on solar power alone. So for a lot of people, if you don't really do that much driving on a day-to-day basis, you know, you drive less than 40 miles per day, you don't have that much cargo that you need, maybe you just need to get to and from work. maybe one other person in the passenger seat. If that it could make a lot of sense for you to have this very efficient thing that you can basically drive for free. Aera at this point does have some prototypes. However, however, they've been unable to come up with a productionready prototype. and these these prototypes have not been validated by any third parties for their efficiency and solar claims. And as we will get into later on in the podcast, there are serious reasons to doubt the solar and efficiency claims that they have made. On the financing side, Aera has been around for quite some time, for many years actually, and they've been they haven't been able to raise significant amounts of capital throughout the years from traditional like private equity or venture capital investors. Instead, in the past few years, they've leaned heavily into equity crowdfunding. So that means they go they set up a website where ordinary people just like you and me can go and sign up to buy thousands thousands and thousands of dollars worth of their stock that is privately held just from their website via equity crowdfunding. So they've been able to raise millions of dollars through this equity crowdfunding from ordinary retail investors. The problem is that over the course of several years, they've kind of burned through the available pool of interested investors and they haven't been able to raise as much money through crowdfunding right now u like recently and they're not they're no longer able to use crowdfunding to hope to raise enough capital to get to low volume production or things of that nature. Just a few days ago on October 16th, , Atura put their listed their shares on the publicly traded stock exchanges listed on the NASDAQ. , they did so via a direct listing, not a traditional IPO. So, in a traditional IPO, , you you actually raise additional capital, new capital from new shareholders and list your shares on the public stock exchanges that way. But with a direct listing, you're only listing existing shares. and you're not you're not usually raising additional capital for the company. when this happened, the dynam the dynamic that happened was existing shareholders who had bought stock via their equity crowdfunding finally like for the first time ever had a way to actually sell their shares. And so what we saw was on the on the first day of trading, the stock price tanked as a result of all these invest these shareholders now finally being able to sell their shares. , and so it's not clear how Appera planned to actually be able to raise capital by listing shares through this direct listing. One interesting thing that they did was there were that this did allow them to open a equity line of credit in a interesting transaction that we'll get into shortly. , but there there are a number of caveats and strings attached to that equity line of credit that we'll get into shortly. And to get into that and other background about APA, I'll kick it over to you James. So now we're going to look at now that they are a publicly traded company, what are some of the challenges that the company still faces. So first off, in addition to all of the technical and production challenges that Abtera has faced, they are also facing legal challenges. So, Appar was actually founded all the way back in 2006 and then it went bankrupt I think in like 2011 and then in 2019. So, after a pause of a few years, the original founders restarted the company. So, it's it went through two iterations, right? There was the first iteration that went bankrupt in 2011. The original founders brought it back in 201 in 2019. Now after the company went bankrupt in 2011, a lot of the intellectual property that Atera owned at that point was sold by the bankruptcy court and it was sold I believe to some Chinese company and that Chinese company never ended up using any of that intellectual property and never created an aerial like vehicle. But they nonetheless owned a lot of this IP. And the IP, I think it might have been bought and sold a few times. And it eventually came to be owned by this company called Zapter. And Zapter, I believe, is just a shell company. , it doesn't really have any real operations. It's just a shell company that holds this intellectual property from the first iteration of a terra. And the people who own Zapter, you know, they own all this intellectual property. They're not using it at the moment, but they did purchase this intellectual property from the first iteration of Abterra. They are now suing the current iteration of Abterra. So the original co-founders of Abterara, they restarted the company and are basically doing the exact they're trying to do the exact same thing, develop this, you know, teardropshaped tricycle thing. And then these Zap Terra people, they're like, "Well, we bought the intellectual property from the bankruptcy court." So the original founders, you shouldn't be allowed to make this exact same design because you don't own that IP anymore. We own it. So there's an ongoing legal battle where Zapter, this shell company, is suing Appara, saying they shouldn't be allowed to basically make the tricycle. So, we don't know what's going to, you know, what's going to happen with this lawsuit, but this is still an ongoing litigation, which represents a major risk to APA to Aera going forward. With that being said, even had it not been for this lawsuit, Aterara is probably still going to be a disaster. That's still going to fail. But this is just, you know, yet another risk to layer on top of that. In addition, in January of 2025, Aterra received a subpoena from the SEC related to their production, design, and manufacturing of their vehicles. So, the SEC is investigating them for something related to the production, design, and manufacturer of their vehicles. So, we don't we have very little information about this SEC investigation. The SEC is investigating Aterara for something potentially related to statements that Aterara has made about the production, design, and manufacturer of their vehicles. Maybe things that Aera has said about those two investors that may be incorrect. We really have no idea what's going on with this SEC investigation, but an SEC investigation is never a good thing. , and that is something that is still ongoing for Atera and is basically another red flag for the company. So the real problem that Atera is facing is that they say to get to low volume production they need $65 million and they were not able to raise $65 million at least not at one time with the equity crowdfunding. So that is why they did the direct listing. They said, "Okay, we need to do this direct listing, get our stock listed on the exchange. That'll make it easy easier for us to raise capital. Then we'll finally be able to raise this $65 million that we need to get into low volume production. So, another thing to consider is when they say they need $65 million to get to low volume production, it's not clear whether or not that includes their baseline level of cash burn because they burn they currently burn about $1.2 million per month just to keep the lights on and pay their own salaries. And they say they need $65 million to get to low volume production. It's not at all clear if that's extra money in addition to their baseline. cash burn or if that's inclusive of the baseline cash burn. Based on how they talk about it in their presentations, it sounds like this is in addition to the baseline cash burn. And they say it's once they raise that $65 million that they need, they need it will take them another 9 to 12 months before they actually begin low volume production. And given their current their baseline burn rate of 1.2 million per month, that 9 to 12 months is going to cost them another 11 to$15 million of cash burn just from the baseline burn rate. So if we add that 65 million they need to get to low volume production plus the burn rate, it's going to take, you know, 70 to 80 million of total cash that they're going to need over the next 12 months to actually get to low volume production. once you once you also include the baseline burn rate. So, how much cash does APA have right now? Well, as of June 30th, 2025, they had $13 million of cash in the bank. Now, they continued raising crowdfunding until July 26th. So, after July 26, they stopped the crowdfunding campaign because then they were, you know, getting ready to do the direct listing. So they had $13 million of cash in the bank on June 30th. After that, throughout July, they also did some more crowdfunding. Maybe they raised another, you know, one or two million dollars from that. But now we're in October. So we also have another four months of cash burn. So once you consider both of those, as of right now, as of October 2025, their cash balance has probably declined to about $10 million as a rough number. Now, they're going to need approximately $80ish million over the next 12 months to get to low volume production. Remember that's $65 million of capital that they need to, you know, buy all the equipment and everything they need to get to low volume production plus the baseline burn rate which is going to add another 10 to$15 million. So given that they only have $10 million right now, they're probably going to need to raise approximately $70 million over the next year to pay for their baseline burn rate plus get to low volume production. So, how are they going to raise $70 million? So, in conjunction with the direct listing, they also entered into a so-called equity line of credit with a company called New Circle Capital. Now, New Circle Capital is this tiny company. they say they have two to 10 employees. I've never heard of them before. They have a very basic website. It seems like a very small company. and they gave a $75 million equity line of credit to Opterra. , and they announced this like a couple days before the direct listing. So, what is this equity line of credit? And does this really mean that Aera is going to be able to get $75 million from New Circle Capital? Well, we have to look at the fine prints of this equity line of credit to see what's actually going to happen. New Circle under certain conditions could purchase up to $75 million worth of Atera stock. However, there are some limitations. Most notably is the so-called ownership limitation. And the ownership limitation states that the investor new circle shall not be obligated to purchase or acquire and shall not purchase or acquire any shares under this agreement which when aggregated with all other common shares beneficially owned by new circle would result in the beneficial ownership by the investor to exceed 4.99% of the then outstanding voting power or number of common shares. So what this is saying is that New Circle is not required to purchase shares that would result in New Circle owning more than 5% of APA's shares outstanding. So that places a limit on how many shares New Circle actually has to purchase. So currently as of the you know so I think this was as of the market close on Friday stock was trading at $584 and that gave a terara a market capitalization of approximately $160 million. So, while the headline value of the New Circle equity line of credit was $75 million, based on that ownership limitation, New Circle is only required to purchase up to 5% of the outstanding shares at any given time. And 5% of 160 million is only $8 million. So, News Circle is only obligated to purchase $8 million worth of shares at any you know, at each time. And also, they purchase the shares at a 4% discount to whatever the trading price is. So, $8 million is obviously a lot less than $75 million, and $8 million is not nearly enough for a terra to get to low volume production. But there is another way that this could play out. Probably what will happen is New Circle is planning to, you know, they'll buy $8 million worth of new shares from Altera at a slight discount. They'll sell those shares onto the market and then they'll probably buy another 8 million and they'll probably keep doing this like repeating this over and over again where they'll buy a few, you know, a relatively small number of shares from Aera at a discount, sell those, buy more, sell them, and that way their ownership will always be below 5% because remember there's a 5% threshold u in the terms of the equity line of credit. And this is potentially a good deal for New Circle because they're buying in at a discount. So if they buy shares at a 4% discount, if they can quickly sell those onto the market, maybe they can make a small profit. But obviously they're taking a lot of risk because this is an extremely volatile stock. So I think realistically what we're going to see happen over the coming months is Aptter is going to be continually drawing on this equity line of credit from New Circle in small amounts and then New Circle is going to be continuously dumping these shares onto the open market which will you know result in further shareholder dilution and also all these new shares that are coming from New Circle will put downward pressure and probably cause a terrace share price to keep declining and declining. Now there's a famous quote from Mark Twain that history does not repeat itself but it does rhyme and I think we can compare a terra to two other electric vehicle companies two other you know micro cap penny stock electric vehicle companies which were in I think very analogous situations. So, the two companies I'm talking about are Faraday Future and Ballinger Innovations. So, Ballinger Innovations, it used to be called Mullen Automotive. , they changed their name a few months ago, but that's Mullen Automotive. So, both of these companies, Faraday and Mullen, they went public. These companies, they went public, you know, on the stock exchanges. These companies were complete failures operationally. , they burned huge amounts of money. they're completely unviable and they funded their losses by issuing new shares and this created kind of a death spiral where they would issue new shares that would put down that would cause dilution and put downward pressure on the share price reducing the company's market cap. Then to fund their losses because their share price was lower the next year they would have to issue even more shares to raise the same amount of capital which would cause the share price to go down even lower and then that would require them to issue even more shares the next year. So you get this death spiral of the share price going down and then them needing to issue larger and larger numbers of shares just to stay afloat. And this caused the sh this caused the share prices to decline extremely quickly. they would have to do many reverse stock splits just to keep their share price above $1 and investors suffered you know a near total loss in both cases you know Google finance rounds the loss to negative 100%. So these have been total losses and the reason why this has resulted this you know hyperinflationary share count. The reason why this came about was because the companies had very small market caps but they burned a lot of cash thus requiring them obliging them to issue obscene amounts of new shares just to keep the lights on. I think we could find ourselves in a similar situation with a terra. So currently, ATER's market cap is only $160 million, a very small market cap. And based on our calculations, they're probably going to need to raise 70ish million over the next 12 months just to get to low volume production. And that's like 50% of their market cap, a huge percentage of their market cap. And as they are issuing those shares, the sh the share price is probably going to decline further and the market cap will decline further. So the rate of dilution is likely to be very extreme and even if they get to low volume production there are huge question marks whether the vehicle is going you know whether the tricycle is going to perform as intended there are huge question marks over the efficiency and solar capabilities of the tricycle. if you want a deeper if you want a deeper dive on that you can look at our main channel Wall Street Millennial Wall Street Millennial where we recently did a video talking about the solar inefficiency claims that Aba has made which are highly questionable. But the point is even if Hera gets into low volume production, they're still going to be losing money and probably going to be losing money for the foreseeable future with the market cap being so tiny relative to how much cash that this company is going to burn. I think it is very likely that they are going their stock is going to end up in a hyperinflationary death spiral just like we saw with Faraday F future and Mullen automotive. So that about wraps it up for what we had to talk about today. As always, if you have any opinions or thoughts about Aterara, please let us know in the comment section below and we will see you all on next week's video.
