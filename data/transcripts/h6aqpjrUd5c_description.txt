How do you go from manually labeling document boxes to processing over a billion pages for the world’s top AI companies?

Adit Abraham is the Co-founder and CEO of Reducto, a Y Combinator (YC) alum that raised $108M from investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Benchmark. Reducto builds the infrastructure AI teams need to parse and extract complex, unstructured data.

In the early days, Adit did the "unsexy" work himself, from labeling data to manually setting up every single subscription. He views these repetitive tasks as a privilege because they mean the company is actually moving forward. In this video, Adit shares his journey from high school side hobbies to leading one of the fastest growing startup. 

This conversation is about the grit behind the growth, choosing hard problems, and why going off the beaten path leads to outlier outcomes.
