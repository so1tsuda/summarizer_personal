Would you believe that the world's third-largest oil reserve is just a bunch of sand soaked oil? And this now represents the cheapest way to extract oil from the earth. Sounds crazy, right? Today, we're going to discuss one of the most interesting energy plays I've ever seen that nobody's talking about. And we'll tell you exactly which stock is the best investment to get exposure to this theme. It also happens to be one of our highest-ranked dividend growth stocks. So, let's start with some interesting facts. Look at this list of countries with the largest proven oil reserves. Ever wonder why the Americans like to spread freedom in places like Iraq, Libya, and Kuwait? Well, now you know. Not a lot of friendly faces on this list, right? Venezuela's been uttering a lot of fighting words lately. They're the country with the largest proven oil reserves. Same for Russia and Iran. Now, perhaps the friendliest face on this list would be Canada. Reminds me of that old joke. You know how to get a 100 drunk Canadians out of your bar? You ask them to leave. Canadians are known for being friendly. Now, these friendly Canadians have nearly five times the amount of oil reserves that the Americans do. And the Americans just happen to be the largest consumers of oil. 20% of the world's oil, followed by China at 13%, and then it dramatically drops off from there. Now, what's rather interesting is that the Saudis are so high on this list, and that's because they use oil to generate electricity. Now, I always thought of the Saudis as sort of the leading producer of oil and the leading exporter of oil to the United States. Well, that's not true at all. This is really incredible if you think about it. The United States now produces more crude oil than any country ever. However, it consumes more crude than it produces. So, therefore, it remains a net importer of oil. And when we look at the countries that the US imports from, again, a rather interesting factoid here. Look at the top three names here. The US imports the majority of its oil from Canada, followed by 11% from Mexico. Rather surprising. Then you have the Saudis at 5%. So over half of all the US's petroleum imports come from Canada. So let's summarize. The Americans use more crude oil than anyone else and also produce more crude oil than anyone else. However, they still need to import crude, and over half of those imports come from Canada. Canada's a country with the world's third-largest proven reserves and a favorable geopolitical climate. And this is remarkable: Canadian firms are now producing oil at a cheaper cost than all other oil majors. How is this possible? Well, it all comes down to oil sands. Now, back in my business school days, we had some BSD come in and teach the class about how to navigate the interview process. And he asked everyone, "Can somebody pitch me a stock?" So, I pitched him Canadian oil sands. That's because back then, my highest conviction thesis was peak oil. Now, that's not necessarily that we're running out of oil. It's just that all the low-hanging fruit, the easy oil to extract is gone. So, now it's more difficult to extract oil and more expensive. Thus, the price of oil ought to go up. And it did. But not for Canada. It's actually going down. Check out this article from Reuters. How Canada's oil sands transformed into one of North America's lowest cost plays. And you see they have a Boston Dynamics robot here. Apparently, it's now conducting routine inspections and saving Imperial Oil around $22 million a year. The article talks about how giant shovels, autonomous trucks, and dog-like robots have all helped Canada's oil sand companies, like Imperial Oil and Suncor, become some of North America's lowest-cost oil producers. And that's even as the worst inflation in a generation has pushed US shale costs up. So, Canada's oil sand industry now finds itself in a position of strength. And I think this diagram says it all. On the left, you have the break even for oil sands, the five largest producers of oil from oil sands that are responsible for the vast majority of that output. And on the right, you see the break even for US producers. So basically oil sands around $40 a barrel, they can still be profitable. And for all the others, it's more like $60 a barrel. And when you look at shale versus oil sands, this is quite interesting. So oil sand producers have lowered their overall cost by approximately $10 a barrel in about 7 years. So for example, autonomous trucks improved the oil output productivity at Imperial's Curo oil sands mine by 20% since 2023. Break even costs across the board have fallen from $53 to $43 for oil sand producers over a 7-year time span. Contrast this to shale oil producers. They need $65 per barrel on average to profitably drill. Now, contrast that to 7 years ago, or so, when US shale producers had a break even price of between $50 and $52 per barrel. So, they're moving in the wrong direction. Shale's getting more expensive. Oil sands are getting cheaper. And I found this incredible. The US actually has the largest known deposits of shale oil in the world. Something like 2 trillion barrels worth. Rather remarkable. And, consequently, about 64% of total US crude oil production in 2023 came from shale. Now when we look at the oil reserves in Canada, they're estimated at around 172 billion barrels. Of those, 95% are in the oil sands deposit in the province of Alberta. So if you consider Alberta and the oil sands and the other oil that it has, then Alberta's share of the oil reserves in Canada is somewhere around 98%. Remarkable. Right? Now, just a little bit more about oil sands. There's really two ways to extract oil from oil sands. First, you have mining, and that's when the oil's very close to the surface. Essentially, they scrape up, I think it's two tons of sand per barrel of oil. These huge volumes of sand and clay are then filtered out so that you just have the oil left. And when the oil's deeper in the ground, these companies inject steam to loosen the deposits and then use a drilling process. So an oil sands mine typically has big initial startup costs, but once it's operational, can run for decades with very low production decline rates. Now, I acknowledge there's an environmental conversation, a rather big one to be had, but we're not going to have that today. Now when we look at investing in this thesis, I asked Gemini and it pointed to the big three. So major producers in the Alberta oil sands are Canadian Natural Resources, Suncor, and Senovas. And then they also mention two other names, Imperial Oil and MEG Energy. And they say that Alberta's total oil sands production around 3.5 million barrels per day. And that these five producers make up the majority of that volume. And of course, the question that we want to answer is what percentage of total revenues would come from oil sands. In other words, if we want oil sands exposure, we want to make sure the companies we're investing in primarily work in that area. And for the names here on the list, you can see that there's a very high percentage of total revenue coming from oil sands, according to Gemini. We can then ask this same question to Grok. It tells us something similar. And basically, these top five names accounted for 80% of Alberta's oil sands output in 2024. Now, we're primarily interested in investing always in leaders. And when we look at Canadian natural resources, which always comes to the top of these lists, they say around 63% of total revenues in 2024 came from their oil sands operations. You can see that broken down here. It's predominantly oil sands mining. Well, they also have the drilling component there as well. So, both methods. And when we look at these two types, they talk about their world-class oil sands mining assets having a lower break even price than any of their other Canadian peers. We like that, right? Leaders often have lower costs of goods sold because - economies of scale. Then we look at the cost of their drilling operation. Again, lower than their peers. So the reason that Canadian natural resources came on our radar was not because of oil sands. It's because it's one of a number of foreign dividend champions. So we have a dividend growth investing strategy called Quantigence, where we've taken over 200 dividend champions across the world and ranked them according to a Q-score which takes into account seven factors for dividend growth stocks that help determine whether or not these companies will continue to increase their dividends over time. As you can see here, Canadian Natural has quite the track record. 25 consecutive years of dividend increases. So, it's a formal champion and that dividend has grown by 21% compound annual growth rate since inception. That's rather remarkable. It's one of the reasons why it has such a high Q-score. And just a side note here, we always make sure to exclude special dividends when we're considering the dividend track record of any given company. So when we go to our dividend growth universe of over 200 stocks, and we filter on energy, here you can see the top four energy stocks ranked. Canadian Natural Resources is actually the second-highest ranked stock in our entire universe and also it was interesting to note Imperial Oil on this list as well. So you have two dividend growth plays here that could potentially give you exposure to Canadian oil sands. Now, it's very important to note that the Canadians generally hold back 15% on dividends paid to non-residents. Apparently, you can claim some foreign tax credit for Americans, but that's really up to you to figure out. Taxation becomes very complicated in a hurry. But from both the oil sands thesis perspective and a dividend growth perspective, we find Canadian Natural Resources to be quite attractive. And we may look to do a future piece on oil sands companies and/or Canadian Resources. We're running out of time today. So just to conclude, we're just one missile launched in the Strait of Hormuz away from oil prices spiking. Now Canada has the most reserves for the least amount of geopolitical risk, and they also produce oil cheaper than anyone else. These numbers are continuing to decline thanks to technologies like robotics and autonomy. And for some reason, oil sands just aren't on the radar of most investors. Maybe they should be. Now, Canadian Natural Resources stands on its own as one of the best dividend growth stocks out there. And it's a great way to play the oil sand story. Now, when it comes to high-performing energy stocks, one stock out there takes the cake. The highest performing energy stock of all time. It's one we happen to be holding.
