Arlan shares the relentless persistence it takes to break into high-stakes environments, revealing the exact process he used to land an internship with the head of Venture Capital at Stanford.

Landing a dream role is rarely about an instant "yes." Instead, it is about the months of follow-ups, the refusal to be ignored, and the core belief that no door is permanently closed. Arlan breaks down the mindset of execution, arguing that the only difference between an average career and the scale of figures like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk is a commitment to curiosity and a refusal to self-limit.

This philosophy of "doing things that don't scale" and having "unreasonable determination" is exactly what Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham looks for in world-class founders. In the world of YC, the most successful people are often those who refuse to take a "no" for an answer and continue to push through the noise until they get their seat at the table.

How do you operate at a global scale when you are starting from zero? Arlan shares a raw look at the power of determination, the art of the cold email, and why the biggest barrier to your success is often the one you have built in your own mind.
