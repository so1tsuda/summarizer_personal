All right, hello and welcome back to the Broken Business Models podcast. We are your hosts, Ryan and James. And before we get started, just a quick disclaimer how we start each of these. Nothing in this podcast should be taken as investment advice. James and I could have positions in any of the stocks we may mention today, and we reserve the right to change those positions at any time. So, always make sure to do your own work and consult with a professional before making any investment decision. With that being said, the topic of today's podcast is going to be the Q3 earnings results of Pure Cycle Technologies. Just a quick reminder for those of you who might not be as caught up on the story. Purecycle Technologies is a company that where their business model is to use this technology that they have to create highquality recycled plastic from recycled material. So the idea is that they have this new technology that can create supposedly create very high purity virgin quality plastic out of recycled material. Whereas existing kind of mechanical recycling techniques can only make you know dark opaque not totally pure material that is not food safe things of that nature. So they have this technology which was de developed by PNG that uses extreme processing techniques to create this very high purity recycled material. However, they've had difficulties ramping it up and operationalizing it at an industrial scale. So, they've had you know, trying to ramp it up to producing industrial quantities of this has led to problems with purity. They recently have had to compound their material with virgin with actual virgin plastic in order to in order to get it to a sellable state which we believe to be indicative of quality issues of their actual u recycled resin. So this is translated to they've not been able to generate material revenue since they went public. Their revenue remains minimal. They've had they've incurred quarterly net losses and negative free cash flow and they've had to rely on continued diluted capital raises in order to fund these losses going into 2025 and in Q3 in particular you know since going public this company has had a history of overpromising and underd delivering. They've had a series of milestones that they have made and subsequently missed. The most recent of which is a commercial partnership that they promised to have with Proctor and Gamble. So in their 2024 investor presentation which they released in February of 2025. They said that they had a partnership with Proctor and Gamble in which they expect to be able to sell a lot a significant amount of product to Proctor and Gamble for use in Proctor and Gamble's packaging materials starting in Q2 of 2025. so we're now in Q3 and these sales have not yet come and they have pushed back their timeline for recognizing the sales to Proctor and Gamble into 2026. So that's just the latest example of a significant milestone that they've had to push back and underdel. In Q3, their sales came in at $2.4 million. So, you know, very low, significant significantly below their guidance for what they said they were going to make in this quarter. meanwhile, the cost of operating their main facility in Iron was about $30 million. So that's about $120 million annually. Their total free cash flow in 2020 in Q3 of 2025 was negative $42 million. So that's about $170 million annually. against two about $230 million of cashing equivalents that they had on their balance sheet at the end of Q3. That means that they over the course of the next year, they're going to have to start making a lot more money or significantly reduce costs or raise even more capital from investors in order to get through the next year of negative free cash flow. So, that's the situation that we find ourselves in at the end of Q3 today. , with that, I'll kick it over to you, James, to talk a little bit more about the specifics of their Q3 earnings release.

>> Yes, thank you. So, let's drill down a little bit deeper. So, as Ryan just explained earlier, they recognized $2.4 million worth of revenue in the third quarter. So, they first started recognizing revenue in the first quarter of 2025. In the first two quarters, revenue was extremely minimal at like $1.6 million each quarter. But then in the in their Q2 when they released Q2 earnings back in August, the CEO gave guidance saying that oh revenue is finally going to start to ramp up in Q3. So this is what he said at their Q2 earnings call in August. So this was already, you know, halfway through the third quarter when the statement was given. With respect to exiting Q3, what we said is that we believe that we could exit Q3 at the $4 million per month revenue level. So they were guiding to $4 million per month in or $4 million in the month of September. Well, if you made $4 million in the month of September, obviously Q3 would be even greater than that. So they were probably guiding to, you know, $6ish million for the entire Q3. Well, as it turns out, the Q3 revenue number came in way below that at 2.4. 4 million. So what they made in the entirety of Q3 was way less than what they were guiding to for the month of September alone. So clearly their revenue ramp up is not going as planned. So what is the cause of this revenue shortfall? Well, to date it appears that their single largest customer was this company called Drake Extrusions. and Drake Extrusions. They buy Pure Cycles recycled plastic. It's actually a compounded version of the recycled plastic. So, it's not completely recycled. It's mixed in with virgin plastic. And then Drake makes fiber out of it. And then Drake will try to resell this fiber to, you know, apparel, automotive, upholstery, cargo makers, etc. So, when they announced their partnership with Drake, I think it was in late 2024, they hyped it up saying, "Oh, this is so great. Drake Extrusions is this massive company that consumes, you know, 60 to 70 million pounds of plastic per year. This is a huge opportunity. We're going to be able to sell so much to Drake." Well, it turns out when Drake went and tried to sell this recycled fiber to its own customers, there was what Pure Cycle calls long brand adoption cycle with highly fragmented demand. That's a nice way of saying Drake was not able to sell a lot of this fiber of this recycled fiber to its end customers. The end customers were not were not interested in buying this recycled fiber. Now, there could be multiple reasons for this. We don't know the pricing of it. Maybe the pricing was very high and Drake's end customers were not willing to pay a premium for this part partially recycled fiber. It could be that there were quality issues. Maybe some of the customers saw quality issues. But either way, the sales of this recycled fiber were much less than expected because end demand from customers was much lower than expected. And that's why we had this massive revenue miss where the revenue in Q3 was less than half of what Pure Cycle was guiding to. And remember, this guidance was made in August. So halfway through the third quarter, they were saying, "Oh, we're going to make $4 million in September alone, which would imply probably like six plus million for the whole quarter." They made less than $2.5 million. So that's a huge miss. , and it shows that Pure Cycle, they really have no idea what end demand is either. they really have no idea what end demand is and they were blindsided just within that quarter that demand from Drake was so low or maybe they were just you know putting out a fake number to try to get investors excited saying that they're going to ramp up revenue. So clearly Q3 was a big disappointment in terms of the reported revenue number. But of course we also have to look at the future and we also have to look at kind of new specifications that Pure Cycle has published talking about the exact specifications of their products. So if you've watched our previous videos about Purycle, we spent a lot of time talking about their so-called compounding initiative. So the original plan for pure cycle was that they would get the type of plastic is called polyropylene. They would get you know this recycled polyropylene feed stock and they claim that they have this process where they can make they can make ver they can make recycled polyropylene that is so good that it's indistinguishable from virgin and that is called purified ultra. Purify ultra is just pure recycled polyropylene. That was their original plan is that they would sell purified Ultra. In 2024, they came out and said they basically admitted in not so many words that there were issues, you know, with the quality of the Purify Ultra. So, they're instead going to sell what they call purify choice. And Purify choice is compounded. So, they take some of their recycled plastic, the recycled polyropylene, and mix it with virgin polyro virgin polyropylene. And they have to do that to get to a high enough purity because the purify ultra on its own didn't have high enough purity. So to increase the purity, they had to mix it with virgin polyropylene. Despite the fact that they said, "Oh, we're going to have to do this compounding mixing it with virgin polyropylene. That's the only way we're going to get to significant sales." Despite announcing this compounding strategy, they continued to claim that they would still make purified ultra. And they said that they could still do it. But to date, they have not sold any Purify Ultra. And to my knowledge, they have not signed any purchase order for any customer to buy Purify Ultra. So, they never sold any of this Purify Ultra. But the idea was that the Pur Ultra is supposedly 100% recycled polyropylene. However, now in the in their most recent in the Q3 investor presentation, they're now showing that the Purified Ultra is only 95% recycled. So, if it's 95% recycled, that doesn't make any sense. So, it's not purified Ultra. It's not pure. If it's only 95% recycled, that means they're putting some virgin plastic into it. So, this whole thing is basically they're basically admitting that this Purify Ultra doesn't actually exist. Not only does it not exist, they're not even selling any of it. So, this in this slide, they're basically confirming what we suspected all along that they cannot get the purity high enough to actually sell Purify Ultra. So what they call purified ultra is actually compounded because it's only 95% recycled, meaning they put 5% virgin plastic in it. So that's something that's that's very important. , and that really shows some of the problems of their technology that it cannot perform as they originally claimed. They cannot make a virgin quality recycled polyropylene. So now let's talk about Proctor and Gamble. So Proctor and Gamble is obviously a massive company and remember Pure Cycle they originally licensed this recycling technology from Proctor and Gamble back you know way 10 plus years ago and for years kind of one of the main bull cases of Purycle is that you know they're going to sell this recycled their recycled plastic to Proctor and Gamble. Obviously with Products and Gamble being so massive, them alone could potentially order a huge quantity of plastic. As Ryan explained earlier, this has been delayed. So they were at first they were supposed to start selling plastic to Proctor and Gamble in 2025. Now this has been pushed back to 2026. But they did say that. So this is what they said in the most recent earnings presentation. They say that they've been doing all these tests with Proctor and Gamble and specifically Proctor and Gamble has been testing the plastic to make the lids for detergent bottles. So, it's the, you know, Proctor and Gamble sells detergent bottles like the Tide or whatever. And then not the bottle itself, just the lid is they're going to get the plastic from Pure Cycle. And then according to Pure Cycle, it passed all the tests and Proctor and Gamble says that it's good and they're gonna try to they're going to start selling it in 2026. However, if you look at it, what they're selling to Proctor and Gamble is a compounded product. So, it's only 52% recycled. So, it's only half recycled. They had to get what the plastic they're selling for these bottle caps. It's half recycled and half virgin. And again, the reason we believe they have to do this is because there are quality issues and so much impurity in the recycled plastic itself that they have to add half virgin to make it to make it work. So what is the purpose for a for a company like Proctor and Gamble? What's the purpose of, you know, buying a recycled plastic? Because the recycled plastic, the whole idea is that's going to be more expensive than virgin plastic and that pure cycle would be able to charge a price premium for this. Well, maybe from a marketing perspective, Proctor and Dan can say, "Oh, you know, we're using a recycled bottle cap. , so we're environmentally friendly and maybe consumers will like that." But the bottle cap is only 50% recycled. And the bottle cap is only a small a tiny percentage of the total amount of plastic used in the entire bottle. So just the cap is 50% recycled as a percentage of the entire bottle. The bottle plus the cap, it's like only 2% recycled because it's only 50% of the cap. The cap is probably only like 5% of the weight, probably less. So from So the entire bottle is going to be one or two% recycled. that's not going to be an effective that's not going to be an effective marketing gimmick. Right? The other thing if we look at the whole idea with Proctor and Gamble, so Proctor and Gamble is such a massive such a massive company that they're going to be able to order huge quantities of plastic from Purycle. Well, let's just look at the illustrative volumes that they give for their projections that this is what they give all the way back in Q4 of 2024. And this is what they supposedly expected to sell to Proctor and Gamble back in 2025. Now, as we know, this has been delayed. This has been pushed back to 2026. But let's just look at the volumes of these numbers. They originally said that they would ramp up over the course of a year and by the end of the year they would be selling 2.5 million pounds of plastic to Proctor and Gamble by the fourth quarter. So that was originally supposed to be the fourth quarter of 2025. Now that's been pushed back to 2026. So, even if we use their own numbers, 2.5 million pounds is not a lot because virgin polyropylene costs about 60ish cents per pound. They claim that they can sell it at a price premium. Now, I don't know how much of a price premium they can actually get, seeing as it's only 50% recycled. But let's say that they can sell it for a dollar, which I think is very generous. But even if it's a dollar, 2.5 million pounds of plastic at a dollar a pound, that's $2.5 million of revenue. The operating costs of their facility in Iron is $30 million per quarter. The company's total cash burn is more than $40 million per quarter. So, Project and Gamble, this massive this massive company, according to Pure Cycle's own projections, after a year of ramp up, they're only going to be making like $2.5 million per quarter when they're burning when Pier Cycle is burning $40 million per quarter. So, the numbers are tiny. Just because Proctor and Gamble is a big company, right? Proctor and Gamble probably consumes like a hundred billion pounds of plastic a year, right? Some some astronomical number of some astronomical quantity of plastic per year. Just because they're experimenting with these half recycled bottle caps from Purcycle, that does not automatically follow that they're going to order, you know, some massive quantity. They might order just a small amount, test it out, maybe they'll use it in limited product runs. Maybe they'll continue with it, maybe they won't. But why would they continue of it when it's only half recycled and the entire bottle is only going to be like 2% recycled? So, it's not really that effective from a from a marketing perspective. And then in addition to Proctor and Gamble, they claim that they have they are they got approval to sell plastic to an unnamed top five quick service retail quick service retail company. So quickservice retail means fast food like McDonald's or Burger King or something like that. So, they claim that they got approved for a top five fast food chain where they're going to sell their recycled plastic for the bottle caps or sorry, the the lids of coffee cups. So, you go to McDonald's, you buy a cup of coffee, there's a plastic lid, the coffee lid on top of that. And they say that, oh, we're going to start selling these coffee lids. And it's called the theforming is the specific application of it. So they have a few different products of this theforming plastic that can be used for the coffee lids. All of them are compounded. None of them are purified ultra, right? And the compounding is as little as 32% recycled. So when they sell it, it might be only 32% recycled and 60% 60ome% virgin. And again, the recycled percentage is so low that are these companies really going to pay a big premium to pure cycle because it's, you know, environmentally friendly, but it's only 30% recycled. So I have my doubts of whether or not these companies are actually, you know, this fast food chain or Proctor and Gamble are actually willing to pay a big price premium. And now let's talk about the volumes. So in the quarter in the conference call, Pure Cycle CEO gave the following kind of guidance about their expected sales volumes with this Proctor and Gamble in this big QSR chain, this big fast food chain. And they also have this carpet customer called Emerald Carpets. So they have these three customers. Proctor and Gamble in the fast food chain are quite big. Emerald carpets is pretty small. But between all three of them, they say that they expect volume in the range of 40 to 50 million pan 40 to 50 million pounds annually. And 40 to 50 million pounds sounds like a lot, but it's actually not that much when you consider the fact that the product that they're selling to these customers, it's only like 30 to 50% recycle. So when they say like the the caps, the detergent caps for Proctor and Gamble, those are only 50% recycled. So that 50 million pounds of product is probably only like 25 million pounds of recycled plastic. And then another the other 25 million is virgin plastic that they buy to mix in with their recycled plastic because that's the only way they can get the purity high enough to be usable. Now we don't again we don't know what the pricing is. Virgin polyropylene is about 60ish cents a pound. Let's be extremely generous and say that they're going to sell it at a massive premium for a dollar a pound for this compounded product which is only like half recycled. That would be that 50 million pounds of volume that would only get them $50 million of revenue. And Iron, their plant in Ohio is currently running at an operating cost of $120 million a year. And based on their own projections, they're only going to be making like $50 million per year. So that's less than half of the operating costs of Iron. And obviously this is not you know and obviously there are variable costs too with buying the feed stock you know sorting the feed stock paying the compounders etc. But the amount of revenue that they're guiding to is quite low compared to their massive fixed costs already. We also have to consider that since this company went public back in 2020 for the past 5 years they have always overpromised and underdelivered. They have always massively missed all of their projections and timelines. So now even but even if we give them the benefit of the doubt which we absolutely should not that they're going to sell 50 million pounds annually that's still a pretty minuscule amount of revenue and they're still going to lose money in 2026. And we also have to talk about the unit economics. So to date, pure cycle sales volume has been so minuscule that we can't really calculate you know what we think their unit economics or gross profit will be because you know the revenue is so little compared to their fixed cost. we can't really make any calculations but the pure cycle their CEO has continued throughout this entire period has continued to give very optimistic commentary about what their unit economics are going to be. So this is what he said on the Q3 earnings call. Even in a challenging consumer spending in prochemical environment, we continue to see robust demand and pricing in line with the unit economics we have previously laid out. So the unit economics they previously laid out back when they did their spa in 2020. They gave a presentation where they talked about what they expect their unit economics for iron to be. Now back at that time they were saying that they were going to make virgin quality polyropylene which they can sell the purified ultra 100% recycled. Since then in fact in 2024 the business model completely changed because there were so many quality issues with the purify ultra they had to completely change the business model to do this compounding. Now that changes everything basically about the economics because it changes it changes the cost because now you have to go out and buy the virgin polyropylene. You have to pay compounders to compound it. Now they say they're going to make their own compounding capacity but that's also going to cost money and it's going to change the volume, right? And it's going to change the price that you sell because the product that you're selling you used to be that you would sell a 100% recycled product. Now you're selling a 30 or 50% recycled product. So the pricing would presumably change. So when they change the business strategy from purified ultra to compounding, everything about the business model changes. Yet the company ex absurdly continues to maintain that they're going to make you know similar economics and you know sim similar IBIDA even after making such a massive change. So that's already not credible. But if we just look so they've maintained that they're going to even despite all these changes, they're going to continue to make a similar similar profits from Iron. But if we just look at the numbers, we can tell that this is clearly absurd. So if you look at their this is from their spa presentation from 2020. They said that Iron would have a name capacity of 107 million pounds per year. They said the operating costs would be 29 cents per pound or $31 million in total. So they said would cost $31 million per year to operate. Okay. In Q3 2025 alone, one quarter, their operating costs for Iron were $30 million. So the cost has increased four times. They said it would cost $30 million a year to operate Iron. Now it cost $120 million per year to operate Iron. And Iron is operating at a tiny fraction of max capacity. And it's still costing four times more than they said it would cost. And they claim that they produced 7.2 million pounds of plastic at Ironon in the third quarter. However, I believe that's the compounded product which is only like 50% recycled. So that means they only made like three and a half million or three and a half million pounds of recycled product from Ironson in the third quarter. Their name plate capacity is 27 million pounds per quarter. So they're operating at about 10% of name plate capacity. Yet it costs them their operating costs are four times greater than what they originally said. So, if your operating costs are now four times greater than what you originally planned, how are you going to come out and say that, oh, the economics are going to be the same? The unit economics are going to be the same. Obviously, the unit economics are going to be way worse because it cost you four times more than expected. Now, the last issue we're going to talk about, oh, actually there's there's two more issues we have to talk about. One is so they have their facility in Iron which they claim can produce 107 million pounds per year of name plate capacity. Right now it's only operating at about 10ish% of name plate capacity. But they claim that it can produce 107 million pounds of 107 million pounds of recycled plastic per year. Then they say, "Oh, we're going to open up all of these other recycling facilities all over the world, and then by the end of the, you know, by 2029, we're going to get to a billion pounds of capacity." That's what they claim right now. And then they're going to make this recently, they announced that they're going to make this facility in Thailand. They're going to make one in Belgium, one in Georgia, and then one somewhere else. So, there's four new facilities that they claim that they're going to make over the next, you know, five, four years. They have not begun construction on any of them. , they've been talking about them for a long time. They have not begun construction on any of them. But the one that was supposed to begin construction, the earliest was Thailand. So, this Thailand facility, they announced it, they disclosed that they were planning to build this Thailand facility in June of 2025. And then at the time and then shortly thereafter they released this presentation where they said that they would begin construction in Q3 of 2025. Well now Q3 is over and they have not begun construction. This is what their commentary was at the Q3 earnings call which happened in November. They said this was a pure cycle CEO. The the growth plan we outlined to the market last quarter continues to progress. Since announcing the Thailand project earlier this year, key feed stock LOIs have been signed and the amount of material available appears to be more than required to run the facility at full capacity. That's basically all they said about Thailand. So they say, oh, they went to Thailand, they talked to some of the feed stock providers. that's, you know, the companies that collect recycled trash that, you know, they would potentially sell to Percle and they signed some probably non-binding letters of intent. So they basically done nothing in Thailand. They went and talked to some people in Thailand. That's all they done. They have not laid a single brick. They have not started construction. And it doesn't look like they've signed any binding contracts to even begin construction. They claim that they would begin construction in Q3. We're now in November. We're well into Q4. And they haven't even begun construction. Now, I don't think they actually have any intention of building this Thailand facility or frankly any of their other facilities. And I'll tell you why. in June of 2025, in conjunction with them raising in June of 2025, in conjunction with them announcing their intention to build this Thailand facility, they also raised $300 million of preferred stock. So, they raised $300 million and they say, "Oh, we're going to use this $300 million plus a bunch of other capital that we expect to raise in the future and we're going to use this money to build the Thailand facility and all these other facilities that we plan to build in the future." Right? So, really the ostensible purpose of this $300 million capital raise was to fund the Thailand facility and they said that they would begin the they would begin construction very quickly. In fact, they have not. They still haven't begun construction, but that $300 million, they're already burning through it very fast. So, at the end of the first quarter, they were down to what, like $20 million of cash, and they burn like 40 million a quarter. So, they at the end of the first at the end of the first quarter, they were almost out of cash. They were they needed to raise additional capital. So, then in June, they raised the $300 million. And that's why we see the big increase in their cash balance at the end of Q2 because they raised this $300 million. Now, they needed to raise capital anyway just to fund their continued cash burn at Iron. But if they come out to the market and say, "Oh, we need to raise a bunch of money because we're losing money at Iron and we expect to continue losing money at Ironton for the foreseeable future or for at least the next few years." Well, that looks very bad because they've been, you know, saying for the past year, oh, we're, you know, right on the verge of signing these big purchase orders which are going to bring us to profitability, right? So, if you just say, we need to raise capital to fund our continued and ongoing losses at Iron, that looks bad. So, instead, they announced, oh, we're going to build this new facility in Thailand. We need to raise this $300 million to pay for Thailand. By the end of Q3, they had their cash balance had declined from that $300 million they raised in June. their cash balance had declined down to $234 million. So by the end of Q3, they had already burned through $66 million of that capital they raised and they have not yet spent a penny in Thailand and we're now in November. So they burned even more money in the past month and they still have not spent a penny in Thailand and they're burning through this cash very quickly. Iron alone is burning, you know, their current cash burn is like 170 million a year. So this $234 million that they have, they're going to burn through that by the end of 2026. And even if they even if we give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they're going to get 40 to 50 million pounds of sales volume in 2026, they're still going to lose money. So they need this money to burn at Iron. So they're not they're not going to have money to spend at Thailand or Antworp or anywhere else. So I don't think they have any intention of actually building this Thailand facility or any of these other facilities. It's just an excuse for them to raise capital which they need to fund their existing cash burn at Iron Center. And then finally this is the last point which I think is still very important. So this kind of goes to the crux of the entire bullcase of of pure cycle. Now, as we explained earlier, the let's take the example of that thing they're selling to Proctor and Gamble, right? Or the thing that they plan to sell to Proctor and Gamble. They plan to sell 50% recycled plastic. So, they're selling a compounded product that's 50% recycled that Proctor and Gamble's going to use to make the detergent caps. So, the cap itself is 50% recycled. the entire bottle is going to be like 2% recycled. Two or three% recycled, right? So, from a consumer marketing perspective, no consumer is going to pay a price premium for an environmentally friendly product that's 3% recycled. But the entire bullc case that pure cycle talks about is like oh all of these states are implementing regulations that at some point in the next few years are going to require plastic manufacturers like Proctor and Gamble and others to u use recycled plastic in their product. And because that's going to be mandated by the government, well then Proctor and Gamble and all these other companies, they're going to be forced to purchase Pure Cycles, you know, recycled plastic and they're going to be forced to pay a premium and that's going to be great for Pure Cycle. And you know, in the most recent in the most recent investor presentation, Pure Cycle put out this map and say, "See, all of these states have have laws have state laws that will mandate for companies to use recycled plastic." Now, let's just look at California. because California is obviously the biggest of these states by far. so it makes more sense to look at them instead of any of these smaller states. So, California, they indeed had a law that would eventually mandate that would eventually mandate manufacturers to use recycled plastic. So, in June of 2022, , California Governor Gavin Muome signed SP54, which will cut plastic p packaging and food wear by 20% over 10 years, require all packaging in the state to be recyclable or compostable by 2032, and require 65% of all single-use plastic packaging and foodear to be recycled in the same time frame. So, that's really the important part, the last part. So, this law would require 65% of all of single-use packaging to be recycled. So, if you have this, you know, mandate, well, that will mean that the manufacturers will be required to buy recycled plastic, and they will potentially be required to buy that plastic from Pure Cycle, you know, if they have to use polyropylene. And Pure Cycle is supposedly the only one that can make that. Now, first of all, if you look at what Pure Cycle is actually selling, it's 52%. And then this mandate is for 65%. So Pure Cycle wouldn't even be able to make the mandate because the quality of their recycled product is so bad. They can only use in the case of Proctor and Gamble, they could only do 50% recycled. So even that wouldn't be enough to meet the mandate. But the more important thing is it doesn't look like this mandate's even going to happen because this thing they signed the law in 2022. It was supposed to go into effect gradually over time and eventually taking full effect in 2032. So this was envisioned to take 10 years to happen. However, it looks like it's actually not going to h it might not even happen at all because in March of 2025, a lot of these plastic manufacturers la lobbyed Gavin Newsome and they told Gavin Newsome, "Hey, this is going to cost way too much money to try to switch to recycled plastic in this time frame and it's going to be too costly for us and we're going to have to raise prices on the products that we sell to consumers. So, this is actually like not a good idea." And then G Gavin Men said, "Yeah, you're probably right. That's not a good idea." And then so he delayed the implementation of this plastic mandate and he told the California regulatory body to come up with new rules that are going to be cheaper and easier for the industry to comply with. So, the idea that all of these states are just going to have all these plastic mandates and they're going to force manufacturers to pay premium prices to pure cycle and then pass that cost on to the consumer is probably not even going to happen because as we see here, just because a state has a law in place, that law can be adjusted or postponed or changed based on pressure that they get from lobby groups. And that looks like exactly what's happening in California. So this whole narrative that there's going to be massive demand, a massive regulatory tailwind, I think is highly questionable. And then if this doesn't happen, if we don't get the regulatory tailwind, then what's what's the purpose of all this? Why would Proctor and Gamble pay a price premium for a 50% recycled detergent cap? None of this, you know, none of this makes any sense. So that about wraps it up for everything we have to talk about Pure Cycle today. As always, if you have any opinions or thoughts about the company, please let us know in the comment section below. And we will see you all on next week's video.
