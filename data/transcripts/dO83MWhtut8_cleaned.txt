Even if you were going to make the worst interpretation of her initial movements where she's let's say she's trying to run over that the that ICE agent from two feet away, you know, albeit slowly. His subsequent shots are unjustified, right? He shot her through the windshield of her car. He's to the side of her car, which is moving at like 2 m an hour. She's already been shot in the face and he shoots her twice more. That part is an execution. , just a quick disclosure, I'm going off camera because I feel like and look worse. Anyways, with that, here is Sam Harris. Sam, where does this podcast find you?

>> , Los Angeles.

>> There you go. With that, let's segue to ICE. What's your reaction to what's happening around I specifically with the shooting and what kind of damage or do you think it's doing damage or maybe if it's in helping Trump and MAGA as a whole? A little backstory here. I've spent a lot of time focusing on the public misperception of police violence, right? I mean, people just, in my experience, don't know how to watch these videos and they the stuff they that they, you know, often think is outrageous really isn't. So when you think of the cop's eye view of the world. So my bias here if anything is to be very charitable to law enforcement because I just you know I've trained a lot with firearms. I've trained a lot with you know you know been trained by law enforcement at various levels. and I just I you know it's very natural for me to see their perspective on these kinds of encounters. I mean just the simple fact that you know when someone is being approached by a cop and you know who's maybe you know intending to arrest them or not just approaching them just approaching their car the moment their hands disappear you know in a country like America where there's your 400 million guns you know that becomes a an evolving emergency right I mean your hands are everything right so and so people have no sense of this right so they immediately you know duck down and reach for something or they just they don't realize they're putting themselves in danger. So that said, the video that we all saw of the this encounter in Minneapolis and the subsequent killing of Renee Good struck me as just a crystal clear instance of a terrible cop, you know, terribly trained doing something quite unjustifiable leading to the death of a of a an innocent civilian, right? I mean, just it was I think I think it any effort to defend it, I just I have not seen even a slightly credible one. even if you were going to defend the first shot, the subsequent two are just clearly an attempt to ensure that she's dead after the cop is just objectively out of harm's way. I mean, it's just not but that, you know, so all of that's alarming and awful, but the worst part was the administration's response to it. I mean, just right out of the gate, they started lying in the most I mean, it's not even you can't even call it lying on some level because this is the it's a type of lying that doesn't makes no pretense of being believable or I mean that like if you if you were going to lie in a way that was meant to deceive, you'd make some contact with the evidence. But here we're just, you know, they just seem to think that they can bludgeon us with lies. You and that's that's what's happening. I mean, just literally every word out of the mouth of the president, the vice president, , Christine Gnome, , I mean, it's just it's it's just all been, you know, a to encourage a kind of mass hallucination. And the fact that so many people seem willing to participate in that hallucination right of center is frankly fairly scary. And what do you make of so what has struck me in addition to your what you highlighted the administration's response is how the media has responded and I can almost tell you how the media responds based on the logo. It just seems like there's a total lack of all critical thinking and I specifically I was especially triggered by Fox who led with you know lesbian activist you know as if to say our audience clearly would hold her more culpable if she we highlighted that she sleeps with someone of the same sex that somehow that might in some way justify or make her seem less or more deserving of this kind of treatment. Any thoughts on how the media has handled it and how people are absorbing it? I've seen a GoFundMe for the officer that includes large donations from fairly public figures.

>> Yeah. Well, I'm not even sure why that would be necessary at this point because it sounds like the administration has said nothing but exculpatory things about him. And I mean, so I can't imagine any kind of prosecution is in the offing. I'm inclined to bend over backwards to be charitable to law enforcement in these situations, but from what we can tell about the vetting and frenzied recruitment of ICE, it's just clearly they're they're putting guns in the hands of people who are spectacularly unqualified to be wielding them. and they're putting them in situations with a kind with a kind of a a philosophy of it's not even law enforcement, right? It's just some kind of public intimidation. , again, it's just it's just not this is not normal police work that we're we're seeing. And I think these kinds of errors, you know, I'm not, you know, be charitable with respect to the intentions of the of the cop in this case, but I mean, it's it's obviously an error to have shot this person and killed her, right? It's just not. And again, the what isn't an error, what or what can't plausibly be thought to be an error is is the ongoing response to this from the government and from, you know, highly partisan media to describe her behavior as clearly terroristic, right? I mean, she's a terrorist who was trying to mow down cops. I mean, not even just the one cop. It sounded like to hear it described from on high. It was it was multiple cops. The cops were just trying to get their car out of the snow. And here came this maniac terrorist activist who was clearly weaponized by some enemy within, right? There's some Antifa cult that has funded all of this, right? Probably George Soros is at the back of it. and turn these drones loose on our our innocent ICE officers. And she just tried to, you know, this is one of the car attacks that we see from jihadists, right? This is this is what you expect to see hearing it described. And then you turn on the video and you and one of these videos was shot by the officer himself, right? I mean, he was you might have asked why he was walking around her car filming her with his own cell phone. I mean, that was bizarre behavior. And then, you know, then Drew with his other hand and shot her through the windshield. , shot her twice more once he she was clearly past him. But from all of that video, you see a an apparently benign person who's who's yes, doing something probably illegal for which maybe she should have been arrested. Yeah. I mean, that's that's fine. She's blocking traffic. She doesn't have a right to do that with her car. But from all of that video, you see a an apparently benign person who's who's yes doing something probably illegal for which maybe she should have been arrested. Yeah, I mean that's that's fine. She's blocking traffic. She doesn't have a right to do that with her car, but the way she handled her car and the contradictory demands she was getting from the ICE agents, there was just no sign of her trying to kill anyone with her car. And again, even if even if you were going to make the worst interpretation of her initial movements where she's let's say she's trying to run over that the that ICE agent from 2T away, you know, albeit slowly. His subsequent shots are unjustified, right? He shot her through the windshield of her car. He's to the side of her car, which is moving at like 2 m an hour. She's already been shot in the face and he shoots her twice more. That part is an execution, right? So, it's just and how we have a government now who will double and triple down on obvious lies. I mean, there's just no burden to correct the record. There's no there's there's nothing careful, you know, it's all partisan bile, you know, and it's so it's it's everything is political, right? like like what we have we're just now in the presence of non adults where like it's just it's a it's a you know Steven Millerish vibe that has spread everywhere where you just start demonizing your critics and making no contact with facts and then wait for the news cycle to move on to the next outrage which will predictably appear within 24 hours given what's happening. with this administration.

>> Yeah, the recruitment strategy for these agents is telling. It feels as if it's very primal. You know, there's an invade. This is an exact quote from the recruiting materials. There is an invasion. We're in a war and we need you to fight. And then the language of protection, invasion, and insurgency. You know, it can feel it can feel masculine and therefore emotionally powerful. What any thoughts on this sort of on this ideology and what it's doing to our society and if there is a mainstream politics anymore?

>> Yeah, it's hard to know where the mainstream is. We have just fragmented so totally with respect to how we consume information. I mean, but what's so disconcerting about this current event is that I mean the information is so clear and you can be reasonably sure that everyone is seeing the same videos, right? I it's not there was this initial moment where there was a video shot from another angle which seemed to make it a little less clear what was happening. But I mean, this is not even a situation where we're we're, you know, so within our echo chambers that we're not making contact with the same data. In this case, I think we clearly are, but the commentary on that data is so hyperartisan and the, you know, then those the echo chambers take over. , I mean, I don't know. It's so this is really not the blue dress yellow dress moment where you can you can understand how people are seeing it so differently. I really I honestly can't understand how anyone can honestly believe the descriptions that have come from the government. So I mean this is a an unusually extreme version of the shattering of our culture based on rival interpretations of facts. , and that's what I think has caused people to kind of spin out so fully on it. , I just yeah, I'm worried. We have a administration who tends to frame everything in terms of there being an enemy within. that it's it's only decent and sane to be kind of filled with hate and fear with respect to some significant subset of your own population. there's no not even a pretense of appealing to all of America with any initiative. It's it's just it's it's intrinsically divisive everything. It's just us against them and them is half of America and it's the institutions and it's the media. It's just I mean it's been going on obviously since you know for about a decade with Trump and Trumpism, but it's getting more and more excruciating to live with its consequences.

>> What do you make of the spread of all the kind of conspiracy thinking both on the left and the right? What need do you think it's fulfilling? Well, I think there's more of it on the right. It is everywhere. This is a kind of generic software flaw we appear to be suffering. But right of center, the appetite for conspiracy thinking is has just I mean it's just grown like a cancer. And I mean the strangest case of it which was which I mean was I think impossible to anticipate it was so extreme was in the the aftermath of the murder of Charlie Kirk. you had Candace Owens you know who's become this sort of kind of supernatural grifting force alleged that u he had been assassinated by you know some combination of the French Foreign Legion and the MSAD and Turning Point itself right turning point she was culpable for if not initiating the assassination they were busy covering it up for some you know I don't think I've heard what how they're incentivized to do this, but on her account, they're they're covering up the murder. , so they have a hand in it. And so she's been saying these things to great effect on the right to millions and millions of people. She has a huge fan base apparently on the right. and the some of the other leading lights of independent media right of center Tucker Carlson and Megan Kelly especially have not wanted to condemn this lunacy right this is she they want to preserve the space for her to say that of course this you know to it's within well within her free speech rights to make these allegations but the amazing thing is that when Tucker and Candace showed up at the Turning Point America Fest conference where the you know the 30,000 true believers are going to show up in person, you know, but to buy but to buy a ticket for the privilege of being in the room where history is made to in again in the aftermath of the murder of their founder and now, you know, patron saint, it turned out that when some people on the stage like Ben Shapiro condemned Candace and her enablers as being more or less the death nail of the of the Republican party and conservatism in America. Half the audience it seemed really wanted to hear more about the conspiracy. Right? So you can tell members of Turning Point that they have had a hand in murdering their founder and half of them want to hear more about that. Right? I mean, that's how masochistic and insane this style of thinking is. And yeah, it's just I mean, it's a deeply unprincipled way of trying to make sense of anomalies in the world, right? I mean any situation you can point to admits of you know highly unparimmonious reckless you know you know cognitively bizarre interpretations right you can just you can just look for anomalies you can ask the question well why you know why was you know I think as as Candace does I mean she asked questions like why did the Egyptian air force have a plane in you know this city on this day, right? Or so it's just look just look for something weird and then begin to pull on that thread. Doesn't matter that it's it makes no connection to all the other threads you're pulling on. It's just this is just some bright shiny object that you can you can spin up into some weird implication. and that's what people I mean this is like a it's a character trait that certain people have. I mean, I am fairly allergic to it, but it's not to say that no one ever conspires or that no conspiracy theories ever turn out to be true, but so often it's it's so obviously unlikely because the incentives aren't aligned. You can't get hundreds, much less thousands of people to be equivalently incentivized to act like psychopaths and conceal the evidence of everyone else's wrongdoing until the end of time. because the incentives are just not aligned that way and people have guilty consciences and people get at cross purposes with their previous collaborators and people want to be famous or they have a change of heart and someone winds up on 60 Minutes spilling the beans about the thing that they conspired to do. but no, with these so many of these conspiracies, what people imagine is just utter competence, just perfect psychopathy married to perfect competence and you know, information concealment and per the perfect alignment of incentives and and a perfect ability to fake a a far more plausible stream of evidence that people get in hand, right? So it doesn't matter that we've arrested the guy who you know quite obviously killed Kirk and that he had you know had the relevant communications about that on his phone and that his family turned him in and etc. I mean it's just it's I don't know it's just it's a species of brain damage that something like a half you know a third to a half of our society seems to be suffering and it's it's a cultural problem at bottom I'm sure but we have to get over it. We'll be right back after a quick break.

I'd like to pivot to what I think is probably the most relative to its implications and importance for women and globally in the Middle East, what feels like proportionally undercovered, and that is Iran. And I'd be very curious to get your thoughts on Iran and how the West and different groups and the media are responding to it.

>> Well, it is undercovered, you know, suspiciously so. I think that could be changing, you know, as we speak today. But, , up until this moment, I mean, up until this very hour, it's really been , a fairly telling silence from the mainstream media. I think it's the reason why it's undercovered is probably twofold. one is the instability there seems to be a feather in Trump's cap with respect to foreign policy. I mean, you can only imagine that our support of Israel and our joining in the bombing of Iran has been the proximate cause of this. And if that winds up being a good thing that you know, it seems inconvenient for many of Trump's detractors. I mean, it's not inconvenient for me. I mean, I obviously despise Trump and Trumpism and you know, 95% of what he's been about as president. But I can readily admit that some things he's done have been good. And one of the things is to be fairly uncompromising with respect to defending open societies and Israel against this specific species of enemy which is you know the global jihadism and the culture that supports it and you know the variant in is in Iran that has been you know a genuine tyranny for you know nearly as long as you and I have been alive. since 1979 is something that we have always we we should we should have always supported the uprisings against. I think it's scandalous how mealymouthed Obama and Biden were on that front. I mean, the Iranians have been showing a lot of courage, especially Iranian women, periodically to try to fight for their political equality going back many years. And under, you know, democratic governments, we have really been shamefully silent. , and that probably leads to the second reason why it's not, you know, obviously Trump isn't the explanation for why Obama and Biden couldn't have supported Iran more or the Iranian people more. , and there it's this lingering moral confusion left of center around Islam and Islamism and jihadism and not wanting to draw too clear a line against the problem of theocracy there, right? I mean there you know Islamic theocracy is a dealbreaker for the West and for open societies. It it's that this is crystal clear, right? And it's and I mean, now we have the spectacle of the UAE announcing, I don't know if you saw this, but the UAE recently announced that they will no longer support their own students studying abroad in the UK for fear that those students will be radicalized on British campuses by the Muslim Brotherhood. Right? That's how bad this is, right? That's that's how blind we have been to the infiltration of our own institutions by this ideology. we have to get our heads screwed on straight around this. And Trump for all of his flaws and for all of the flaws of the people around him, I mean the truly awful people around him who you know just psychopaths and grifters and no nothings, incompetence. the general shape of their their corruption and their selfstealing and their unprofessionalism still leans in the direction of sanity on this point, right? There's just not much tolerance for jihadism and Islamism coming out of out of you know, both within in the West and coming from societies like Iran. And so, you know, I you know, I think Trump is a very uncertain ally for everyone, including Israel given his aptitude for for corruption and just you know, pure self-interest and just his distractability. But, you know, thus far, he's been better than many people could have hoped and certainly than many than really any Democrat would have been expected to be, at least at this moment. I hold out hope that it'll be a different story in 2028. But I do think Trump has been better on this issue than we would have any right to have expected Kla Harris to have been. , and , yeah, I take it caused me a fair amount of pain to to admit that, but I just think it's true.

>> Are you familiar with Alica Leon?

>> , no. No.

>> She's a really impressive she's an author or just a commentator, but I saw some content of hers and it kind of reminded me of you and she has something she calls the moral color code. And it's not about the oppression of people or how severe or widespread the oppression or the horror is. It's about the color of the skin of the oppressor that mandates or deems the reaction from the west and progressive media. And she uses Iran as an example that the left goes into moral paralysis

>> when the oppressor is brown. And that

>> yeah,

>> if you look at what's happening in Iran, Iraq, Sudan, you know, on and on and on versus it that inspires a muted reaction versus an oppressor that's conflated with being rich and white, specifically Israel that they're just entirely different reactions. And I thought of you. Any thoughts?

>> Yeah. And I if one thing can be said for certain on this front is that the world doesn't much care. I mean the West the and the liberal west doesn't much care when Muslims kill other Muslims really in any number. I mean we're there are instances where you can point to hundreds of thousands of dead in Syria and Yemen and Sudan. but the world really cares when Westerners do it and the world especially cares when Jews do it. Right? Right. I mean, that's that's the thing that just you know, lit up our information landscape after the war in Gaza started or in fact before it started. The merely the prospect of Israel retaliating against the worst atrocity against Jews since the Holocaust, right? I mean, we had people supporting Hamas before Israel had made a move in response. it's just, you know, everything is upside down here. I mean, we're, you know, something like twothirds of countries have an origin story that is similar to Israel's in the sense that, you know, map makers just simply drew lines on paper without much regard for the lives of the people living within those frontiers. , you know, there there countries, you know, formed the same year as Israel, like Pakistan who have similar origin stories, but only Israel has to defend its right to exist, right? But only Israel has to continually litigate this. , and the United Nations has passed more resolutions against Israel than all other countries combined, right? I mean, these countries include places like Yemen and Sudan and Syria. You know, countries that have perpetrated actual genocides, right? So, none of this makes any sense. This is just, you know, the the only interpretation that makes sense of it is anti-semitism in some form based on some rationale that, you know, goes unexpressed. But it's so yeah, I mean, this is this issue has pretty much destroyed the moral intuitions of the left and you know, it it's not only a problem for Israel or for Jews. I mean, this just gets mapped on to our domestic politics. I mean, we're living in a country where, you know, when you find when you hear that some act of violence occurred on a a subway car, say, and, you know, someone was killed, you know, someone someone there were many innocent bystanders and someone was killed. You can describe it as exhaustively as you like. I mean, you can tell ex you can tell people exactly what happened, how it escalated, whether there were weapons involved, how many who was the attacker and who was a, you know, how and how the how he behaved. moments before and after, etc. You can describe everything about it. You know, every morally and legally salient detail, but something like half of our society won't know quite how they feel about what you've just described until you tell them the skin colors of the people involved, right? You know, was the attacker white or black? Was the victim white or black? that's just obscene, right? that this is just a flaw in our moral and social psychology and we have to figure out how to get over it. And unfortunately, left of center, I mean, in democratic politics, you still have the this misapprehension of that identity politics is somehow worth preserving, right? right? That we have to keep trumpeting the primacy of identity and insinuate race and racial concerns and you know other identitarian concerns into you know into every instance. , and it's if we can't get over that left of center, , you know, fairly immediately. I just I think, you know, I think 2028 is, , is going to be a story of, , President Vance or his , you know, or whoever's adjacent to him , in the Republican party. And, , yeah, that's that's fairly scary.

>> Joe, you feel it? And I'll give you an example. Well, I also want to acknowledge that I probably had a lot of well I know I had a lot of advantage because of my identity through the 90s raising money in e-commerce and you know it would just didn't hurt to be a white guy with a sha white heterosexual guy with a shaved head raising money in Silicon Valley relative to other groups. I have really sensed lately and I'm pretty sure that you must sense this with my book talking about an aspirational code for masculinity or the struggles that men face. I've come to the conclusion I'm the wrong messenger because why dude of my age talking about men in any means that is sympathetic towards them is just evokes a gag reflex from the left. It just and I'd like to think or I'm hoping it's not my arguments. I thought I think it is some of it's my identity and I've come to the conclusion that it I'm just maybe the wrong messenger. Do you feel like your identity gets in the way of your message?

>> Oh, it certainly does. it doesn't get in the way of my stating it, but it gets in the way of the audience hearing it. There's no question. , and that's again that's a real cultural flaw at this point. I mean, it is in large measure what has given us Trump and Trumpism. I blame the left as much as I blame the right for Trump and Trumpism. I mean, you know, I can speak endlessly on either topic, but there there's something more gling about the left's culpability here because it's just it's so unnecessary. is such a spectacular own goal, right? I mean, it's it should be so easy for us to champion our values of political equality and to fight for them and to resist bigotry of every form, you know, whether it's racism or misogyny or transphobia or whatever it is, right? We can resist all of these things while remaining sane and and intellectually honest, right? And it's just but the Democratic Party has been so captured by its activists, which is you probably 8% of Democrats at best, that yeah, I mean, the p the pandering to the loudest and most hysterical of the far left has to stop. And you know I you know I hope it's I hope we reach the high water mark somewhere around 2024, but you know we'll know as we get closer to the midterms. I expect

>> I want to pivot the example you used of Britain of basically it's interesting that the UAE and several Gulf nations are much more freaked out, wary concerned about radical Islam than many Western governments. If you got a call from, I don't know, name your Senate Intelligence Committee or Congressional Congressional Caucus, whatever, and they said, "Sam, we see this as a real threat." What do you think in terms of specific policy recommendations would you make to address the threat? Maybe it's a tiny number of committed jihadists, but in if you're going to talk about the wider culture of support for jihadism, the wider culture of people who think that really it is incumbent upon you know any god-fearing Muslim to wage war against the infidel at least in some way at some point or to support those who do. and that you know infidels and apostates and Jews are fit only for the fires of hell and that we you really want to you know follow Muhammad's example and have a very muscular attitude towards spreading the one true faith to the ends of the earth. That's a much larger footprint. We just we need an honest conversation about this. What what we need to provoke is a kind of renaissance/reformation civil war depending on the context within the Muslim world against jihadism and against you know a 7th century attitude toward theocracy. and we're just nowhere near being able to do that especially on the left. I mean on the right you have people who are willing to speak honestly about the threat but they are you know Christian nationalists you know and fascists right I mean they are they are their own problem you know with respect to demagoguery and dogmatism and even aspiring theocracy right I mean so that's that's obviously unhelpful but it's it's just true as you know David from has now famously said that you know if liberals won't enforce borders fascists will

>> fascist will And we need we need a left that understands that open societies are vulnerable to what Carl Pauper called the paradox of tolerance which is that the tolerance of open societies can be used against them to subvert them from within. And Islamists you know and is Islamist organizations like the Muslim Brotherhood are very cleareyed about this. I mean they have they have for now generations been working to subvert open societies from within by the you know by the very levers that we you know we want to protect you know free speech and tolerance of diversity right and they've managed to frame any criticism of dangerous ideas within Islam as bigotry so even if you're fighting for the equal rights of women and in a in a country like Thran where you know women are being imprisoned or even killed for just showing their hair, right? They this notion of Islamophobia, it manages to frame those concerns, those genuine, you know, civil rights and humanitarian concerns as a form of bigotry, right? And it's not a form of bigotry. criticizing Islam as a system of ideas is not is no more a form of bigotry than criticizing communism as a system of ideas. and it's not at all, you know, analogous to anti-semitism as we, you know, if we could easily I could easily describe to you, but it's it's mistaken for bigotry against a people based on indelible characteristics like race and ethnicity. And it simply isn't. Right? I Islam is a system of ideas that now exists in at least a hundred countries. And it is it has some attitudes toward things like the rights of women and free speech and you know the freedom to change your faith that are deeply inacronistic and dangerous. and we have to we have to be honestly criticizing these ideas.

>> Okay. So, you get a call from the chair of the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator Tom Cotton, and the vice chair, , Senator Mark Warner, and they say, "Sam, we hear you. , whether it's 20 million or 60 million, , what do we do? What specific policies do you think that you would recommend to the select committee that they consider implementing?" Well, we should empower genuine secularists and apostates, you know, ex-Muslims wherever we can. I mean, there's no one more articulate on this topic than ex-Muslims. I mean, people from these various cultures, right, about whom this the identity politics game cannot be played, right? So, half the people listening to us right now are beginning to winge about, you know, two white guys talking about this and this is just Islamophobia, right? So what you really need for this conversation to run through if it if it can in left of center circles is to have you know an ex-Muslim from you know the Arab world or from you know Pakistan or some relevant place who speaks the language who knows what is being said you know behind closed doors not in English who knows exactly how deep anti-semitism and misogyny and other you know noxious variables run within the teachings of Islam who can't be, you know, who can't be snowed on these topics. , and you need that you need to empower those people. You need to empower and then and you then you need to find the genuine liberals and genuine secularists within the Muslim world. And that is very hard. It's not that they don't exist, but it's it's difficult, right? I mean, all the definitions of terms change when you get into these cultures, right? And and to talk about fundamentalism is not the same as talking about fundamentalism in a Christian context in America. and so it's we need to provoke again a kind of renaissance and reformation and when push comes to shove a civil war in places where jihadism and Islamism are very threatening and that's and unfortunately that's increasingly in places in the west and we go to sleep on this issue. it just takes the next terrorist atrocity to wake us up for a time, you know, the next Charlie Hebdo massacre or, you know, Baklan attack, you know, in a in a country like France, then all of a sudden we take this issue seriously. But you know, that all of that has a certain half-life and we go to sleep again. I generally speaking, we need to recognize that we don't want more Islamists and jihadists in our societies, right? That has immigration implications. that has immigration implications that are uncomfortably that have uncomfortable echoes of the kinds of bigoted and crazy things someone like Steven Miller will say. Right. So you know so when Steven Miller or Donald Trump will say like we want we don't want any more Muslims from hole countries. Right. Right. There's a kernel of truth in that. Right. You have to cut through the bigotry and you know you know moral insanity that those guys just radiate from their pores. But there is a kernel of truth. We don't want any more you know true believers who have no intention of assimilating in the west in our open societies right and people do come here with no intention of assimilating. that's just a fact. It's it's it's not even a secret. It's it's I mean you can just read the documents that are you know that you know have you know Muslim Brotherhood signatures on them attesting to this right so it's and then we have our own internal organizations like the Council of American Islamic Relations that left of center get treated by journalists like they're the Muslim version of the ACLU or the NAACP but they're actually stealth Islam Islamist organizations that have direct ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Right. So it's and you have you have the fact that a country like Qatar country the country of Qatar is the largest funer the largest foreign funer of American universities at this point. It's it's it's genuinely sinister, right? This is not there's nothing benign about that. and left or center people are reliably confused on this on this subject and it's the confusion is not going to age well. But crucially, Muslims who really want to live in open societies and want to support secular values that make that possible will be the first people to recognize the danger of certain of their co-religionists, right? And it's the fear that they won't that needs to be examined, right? Right? I mean, like we have this fear on the left that if you if you speak too honestly about what's really in the holy books and talk about how dysfunctional all that is, you're going to alienate all the good Muslims. Right. Well, if that's the problem, then we've then we have a much bigger problem than you know even I'm willing to admit, right? No. No. The good Muslims, the good, the sane ones, the ones who want to live the way we want to live, right, in tolerant open societies are not going to be alienated by an honest discussion of the doctrines around apostasy and blasphemy and homosexuality and jihad that really exist within the tradition and which really have to be kind of theologically recontextualized and disavowed and sidelined politically in our societies. , and if that's not on the menu for most Muslims, then we have, you know, then it's going to be a very dark future, right? And I mean, and that's not the future I expect, but that's the future that people seem to fear when they when they want to castigate someone like me as an Islamophobe for the things I just said.

So, you've been very generous with your time and as we wrap up here and there's no way to make this altitude change elegantly, but whenever we get together, the one of the things I enjoy the most is talking about

>> talk about erectile dysfunction.

>> Yeah, that's well that's just a given at our age. but I'm just curious any observations or thoughts you want to share about raising teenagers and your observations around having teenagers. I do think that they're they can be, you know, more sophisticated than we might expect in navigating the space because I mean it's evolving so fast and they're digital natives in a way that we're not. I'm humbled by how much control we don't have. I mean the I mean the research seems to suggest that you know any pretention that that you're going to really impart your view of the world and your interest to your kids beyond just giving them your genes you know and their kind of native interests and aptitudes is fairly forlorn. I mean it's just not it's just not the what the research shows. I mean the re research shows that for basically anything of interest psychologically and as a matter of character you know it's like 50% genetic and 50% environmental but the environment is not your parenting right it's it's so you know it matters who their friends are matters you know what school they go to some degree it matters it matters the culture that gets in but we have very little control over that I've noticed. Right. Like you pick you pick a nice like in the most privileged case you get your you struggle to get your kid into a private school that you hope is going to be good but really you have no control over what that looks like and you know you have no control over the teachers they wind up getting and there are many disappointments to be had on that front and surprises. , and you can't pick their friends and their friends turn out to be, you know, good or bad depending. And , it really is a just a great spin of the lottery wheel, right? It's just it's just the roulette wheel. It's just not a control is not obvious. , but good intentions can be, right? I mean, like we really live with the character of our intentions here. I mean that's what colors your mind with respect to your moment to moment engagement with other people. And if you love your kids and you want them to thrive and you delight in their their you know creativity and you know you're going to have an experience of parenting which is beautiful despite the fact that you really don't have a lot of control over the world or their lives in the world. If you can think of them, give me one or two things that your wife and your daughters think of you that is in stark contrast to what people think about you publicly. Oh, well, I mean I can be the silly dad in a way that would be it would I would be unrecognizable to my audience if you know. Yeah, the home videos of me with the cats or with my daughters, I think would show a face of me that would fairly astonish my audience. those videos are never getting out, but but yeah, they they exist. but I mean that I mean I you there is something I do as you can tell from this the hour we've already spent I can get into a zone where you because of the topic and because of you know my thoughts on it. I'm you know I'm in I'm in an orbit where that doesn't allow for many of the other sides of my personality to come through or at least you know you know for whatever reason I you know I don't allow it or it just doesn't happen. And I remember being quite amazed that the first time my wife Anukica came on my podcast I forget what episode it was. I mean it was it was not a early episode. It might have been like episode 100 or something or maybe 80. was the first time that my audience had ever heard me laugh. and you know it was like a it was like a some kind of religious revelation. I mean, like the response to it was just insane. , so anyway, I mean, that's Yeah, I'm a I'm a peculiar podcaster, I guess. But, , I think a reasonably fun dad with and my girls could probably attest to that.
